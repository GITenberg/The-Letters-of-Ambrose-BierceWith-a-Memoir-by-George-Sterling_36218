<p><i>"The question that starts to the lips of ninety-nine readers<span class="pagenum">v</span>
out of a hundred," says Arnold Bennett, in a review
in the London </i><span class="smcap">New Age</span><i> in 1909, "even the
best informed, will assuredly be: 'Who is Ambrose Bierce?'
I scarcely know, but I will say that among what I may term
'underground reputations' that of Ambrose Bierce is perhaps
the most striking example. You may wander for years
through literary circles and never meet anybody who has
heard of Ambrose Bierce, and then you may hear some erudite
student whisper in an awed voice: 'Ambrose Bierce is
the greatest living prose writer.' I have heard such an opinion
expressed."</i></p>

<p><i>Bierce himself shows his recognition of the "underground"
quality of his reputation in a letter to George Sterling: "How
many times, and during a period of how many years must
one's unexplainable obscurity be pointed out to constitute
fame? Not knowing, I am almost disposed to consider myself
the most famous of authors. I have pretty nearly ceased
to be 'discovered,' but my notoriety as an obscurian may be
said to be worldwide and everlasting."</i></p>

<p><i>Anything which would throw light on such a figure, at once
obscure and famous, is valuable. These letters of Ambrose<span class="pagenum">vi</span>
Bierce, here printed for the first time, are therefore of unusual
interest. They are the informal literary work&mdash;the term
is used advisedly&mdash;of a man esteemed great by a small but
acutely critical group, read enthusiastically by a somewhat
larger number to whom critical examination of what they
read seldom occurs, and ignored by the vast majority of readers;
a man at once more hated and more adored than any on
the Pacific Coast; a man not ten years off the scene yet already
become a tradition and a legend; whose life, no less than his
death, held elements of mystery, baffling contradictions, problems
for puzzled conjecture, motives and meanings not
vouchsafed to outsiders.</i></p>

<p><i>Were Ambrose Bierce as well known as he deserves to be,
the introduction to these letters could be slight; we should not
have to stop to inquire who he was and what he did. As it is,
we must.</i></p>

<p><i>Ambrose Bierce, the son of Marcus Aurelius and Laura
(Sherwood) Bierce, born in Meiggs County, Ohio, June 24,
1842, was at the outbreak of the Civil War a youth without
formal education, but with a mind already trained. "My
father was a poor farmer," he once said to a friend, "and
could give me no general education, but he had a good library,
and to his books I owe all that I have." He promptly volunteered
in 1861 and served throughout the war. Twice, at
the risk of his life, he rescued wounded companions from the
battlefield, and at Kenesaw Mountain was himself severely
wounded in the head. He was brevetted Major for distinguished<span class="pagenum">vii</span>
services; but in after life never permitted the title to
be used in addressing him. There is a story that when the war
was over he tossed up a coin to determine what should be his
career. Whatever the determining auguries, he came at once
to San Francisco to join his favorite brother Albert&mdash;there
were ten brothers and sisters to choose from&mdash;and for a short
time worked with him in the Mint; he soon began writing
paragraphs for the weeklies, particularly the </i><span class="smcap">Argonaut</span><i>
and the </i><span class="smcap">News Letter</span><i>.</i></p>

<p><i>"I was a slovenly writer in those days," he observes in a
letter forty years later, "though enough better than my neighbors
to have attracted my own attention. My knowledge of
English was imperfect 'a whole lot.' Indeed, my intellectual
status (whatever it may be, and God knows it's enough to
make me blush) was of slow growth&mdash;as was my moral. I
mean, I had not literary sincerity." Apparently, attention
other than his own was attracted, for he was presently editing
the </i><span class="smcap">News Letter</span><i>.</i></p>

<p><i>In 1872 he went to London and for four years was on the
staff of </i><span class="smcap">Fun</span><i>. In London Bierce found congenial and stimulating
associates. The great man of his circle was George
Augustus Sala, "one of the most skilful, finished journalists
ever known," a keen satiric wit, and the author of a ballad of
which it is said that Swift might have been proud. Another
notable figure was Tom Hood the younger, mordantly humorous.
The satiric style in journalism was popular then; and
"personal" journals were so personal that one "Jimmy"
Davis, editor of the </i><span class="smcap">Cuckoo</span><i> and the </i><span class="smcap">Bat</span><i> successively,
found it healthful to remain some years in exile in France.<span class="pagenum">viii</span>
Bierce contributed to several of these and to </i><span class="smcap">Figaro</span><i>, the
editor of which was James Mortimer. To this gentleman
Bierce owed what he designated as the distinction of being
"probably the only American journalist who was ever employed
by an Empress in so congenial a pursuit as the pursuit
of another journalist." This other journalist was M.
Henri Rochefort, communard, formerly editor of </i><span class="smcap">La Lanterne</span><i>
in Paris, in which he had made incessant war upon
the Empire and all its personnel, particularly the Empress.
When, an exile, Rochefort announced his intention of renewing
</i><span class="smcap">La Lanterne</span><i> in London, the exiled Empress
circumvented him by secretly copyrighting the title, </i><span class="smcap">The
Lantern</span><i>, and proceeding to publish a periodical under
that name with the purpose of undermining his influence.
Two numbers were enough; M. Rochefort fled to Belgium.
Bierce said that in "the field of chromatic journalism" it
was the finest thing that ever came from a press, but of the
literary excellence of the twelve pages he felt less qualified
for judgment as he had written every line.</i></p>

<p><i>This was in 1874. Two years earlier, under his journalistic
pseudonym of "Dod Grile," he had published his first
books&mdash;two small volumes, largely made up of his articles
in the San Francisco </i><span class="smcap">News Letter</span><i>, called </i>The Fiend's
Delight<i>, and </i>Nuggets And Dust Panned Out In California<i>.
Now, he used the same pseudonym on the title-page of
a third volume, </i>Cobwebs from an Empty Skull<i>. The
</i>Cobwebs<i> were selections from his work in </i><span class="smcap">Fun</span><i>&mdash;satirical
tales and fables, often inspired by weird old woodcuts given<span class="pagenum">ix</span>
him by the editors with the request that he write something
to fit. His journalistic associates praised these volumes liberally,
and a more distinguished admirer was Gladstone, who,
discovering the </i>Cobwebs<i> in a second-hand bookshop, voiced
his delight in their cleverness, and by his praise gave a certain
currency to Bierce's name among the London elect. But
despite so distinguished a sponsor, the books remained generally
unknown.</i></p>

<p><i>Congenial tasks and association with the brilliant journalists
of the day did not prevent Bierce from being undeniably
hard up at times. In 1876 he returned to San Francisco,
where he remained for twenty-one years, save for a brief
but eventful career as general manager of a mining company
near Deadwood, South Dakota. All this time he got his
living by writing special articles&mdash;for the </i><span class="smcap">Wasp</span><i>, a weekly
whose general temper may be accurately surmised from its
name, and, beginning in 1886, for the </i><span class="smcap">Examiner</span><i>, in which
he conducted every Sunday on the editorial page a department
to which he gave the title he had used for a similar column
in </i><span class="smcap">The Lantern</span>&mdash;Prattle<i>. A partial explanation
of a mode of feeling and a choice of themes which Bierce developed
more and more, ultimately to the practical exclusion
of all others, is to be found in the particular phase through
which California journalism was just then passing.</i></p>

<p><i>In the evolution of the comic spirit the lowest stage, that of
delight in inflicting pain on others, is clearly manifest in savages,
small boys, and early American journalism. It was exhibited
in all parts of America&mdash;Mark Twain gives a vivid<span class="pagenum">x</span>
example in his </i>Journalistic Wild Oats<i> of what it was in
Tennessee&mdash;but with particular intensity in San Francisco.
As a community, San Francisco exalted personal courage,
directness of encounter, straight and effective shooting. The
social group was so small and so homogeneous that any news
of importance would be well known before it could be reported,
set up in type, printed, and circulated. It was isolated by so
great distances from the rest of the world that for years no
pretense was made of furnishing adequate news from the
outside. So the newspapers came to rely on other sorts of interest.
They were pamphlets for the dissemination of the opinions
of the groups controlling them, and weapons for doing
battle, if need be, for those opinions. And there was abundant
occasion: municipal affairs were corrupt, courts weak
or venal, or both. Editors and readers enjoyed a good fight;
they also wanted humorous entertainment; they happily combined
the two. In the creative dawn of 1847 when the foundations
of the journalistic earth were laid and those two morning
stars, the </i><span class="smcap">Californian</span><i> of Monterey and the </i><span class="smcap">California
Star</span><i> of San Francisco, sang together, we find the
editors attacking the community generally, and each other
particularly, with the utmost ferocity, laying about them
right and left with verbal broad-axes, crow-bars, and such
other weapons as might be immediately at hand. The </i><span class="smcap">California
Star's</span><i> introduction to the public of what would,
in our less direct day, be known as its "esteemed contemporary"
is typical:</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>"We have received two late numbers of the </i><span class="smcap">Californian</span><i>, a<span class="pagenum">xi</span>
dim, dirty little paper printed in Monterey on the worn-out materials
of one of the old California </i><span class="smcap">WAR PRESSES</span><i>. It is published
and edited by Walter Colton and Robert Semple, the one a </i><span class="smcap">WHINING
SYCOPHANT</span><i>, and the other an </i><span class="smcap">OVER-GROWN LICK-SPITTLE</span><i>.
At the top of one of the papers we find the words 'please exchange.'
This would be considered in almost any other country a
bare-faced attempt to swindle us. We should consider it so now
were it not for the peculiar situation of our country which induces
us to do a great deal for others in order for them to do us a
little good.... We have concluded to give our paper to them this
year, so as to afford them some insight into the manner in which
a Republican newspaper should be conducted. They appear now
to be awfully verdant."</i></p>
</div>

<p><i>Down through the seventies and eighties the tradition persisted,
newspapers being bought and read, as a historian of
journalism asserts, not so much for news as to see who was
getting "lambasted" that day. It is not strange, then, that
journals of redoubtable pugnacity were popular, or that editors
favored writers who were likely to excel in the gladiatorial
style. It is significant that public praise first came to
Bierce through his articles in the caustic </i><span class="smcap">News Letter</span><i>,
widely read on the Pacific Coast during the seventies. Once
launched in this line, he became locally famous for his fierce
and witty articles in the </i><span class="smcap">Argonaunt</span><i> and the </i><span class="smcap">Wasp</span><i>, and for
many years his column </i>Prattle<i> in the </i><span class="smcap">Examiner</span><i> was, in the
words of Mr. Bailey Millard, "the most wickedly clever, the
most audaciously personal, and the most eagerly devoured
column of </i>causerie<i> that ever was printed in this country."</i></p>

<p><i>In 1896 Bierce was sent to Washington to fight, through<span class="pagenum">xii</span>
the Hearst newspapers, the "refunding bill" which Collis
P. Huntington was trying to get passed, releasing his Central
Pacific Railroad from its obligations to the government.
A year later he went again to Washington, where he remained
during the rest of his journalistic career, as correspondent
for the New York </i><span class="smcap">American</span><i>, conducting also for
some years a department in the </i><span class="smcap">Cosmopolitan</span><i>.</i></p>

<p><i>Much of Bierce's best work was done in those years in San
Francisco. Through the columns of the </i><span class="smcap">Wasp</span><i> and the </i><span class="smcap">Examiner</span><i>
his wit played free; he wielded an extraordinary
influence; his trenchant criticism made and unmade reputations&mdash;literary
and otherwise. But this to Bierce was mostly
"journalism, a thing so low that it cannot be mentioned in
the same breath with literature." His real interest lay elsewhere.
Throughout the early eighties he devoted himself to
writing stories; all were rejected by the magazine editors to
whom he offered them. When finally in 1890 he gathered
these stories together into book form and offered them to the
leading publishers of the country, they too, would have none
of them. "These men," writes Mr. Bailey Millard, "admitted
the purity of his diction and the magic of his haunting
power, but the stories were regarded as revolting."</i></p>

<p><i>At last, in 1891, his first book of stories, </i>Tales of Soldiers
and Civilians<i>, saw the reluctant light of day. It had this for
foreword:</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>"Denied existence by the chief publishing houses of the country,
this book owes itself to Mr. E. L. G. Steele, merchant, of this city,
[San Francisco]. In attesting Mr. Steele's faith in his judgment<span class="pagenum">xiii</span>
and his friend, it will serve its author's main and best ambition."</i></p>
</div>

<p><i>There is Biercean pugnacity in these words; the author
flings down the gauntlet with a confident gesture. But it
cannot be said that anything much happened to discomfit
the publishing houses of little faith. Apparently, Bierce had
thought to appeal past the dull and unjust verdict of such
lower courts to the higher tribunal of the critics and possibly
an elect group of general readers who might be expected to
recognize and welcome something rare. But judgment was
scarcely reversed. Only a few critics were discerning, and
the book had no vogue. When </i>The Monk and the Hangman's
Daughter<i> was published by F. J. Schulte and Company,
Chicago, the next year, and </i>Can Such Things Be<i> by
The Cassell Publishing Company, the year following, a few
enthusiastic critics could find no words strong enough to describe
Bierce's vivid imagination, his uncanny divination
of atavistic terrors in man's consciousness, his chiseled perfection
of style; but the critics who disapproved had even
more trouble in finding words strong enough for their purposes
and, as before, there was no general appreciation.</i></p>

<p><i>For the next twenty years Ambrose Bierce was a prolific
writer but, whatever the reason, no further volumes of stories
from his pen were presented to the world. </i>Black Beetles
in Amber<i>, a collection of satiric verse, had appeared the
same year as </i>The Monk and the Hangman's Daughter<i>;
then for seven years, with the exception of a republication
by G. P. Putnam's Sons of </i>Tales of Soldiers and Civilians<i>
under the title, </i>In the Midst of Life<i>, no books by Bierce.<span class="pagenum">xiv</span>
In 1899 appeared </i>Fantastic Fables<i>; in 1903 </i>Shapes of
Clay<i>, more satiric verse; in 1906 </i>The Cynic's Word
Book<i>, a dictionary of wicked epigrams; in 1909 </i>Write it
Right<i>, a blacklist of literary faults, and </i>The Shadow on
the Dial<i>, a collection of essays covering, to quote from the
preface of S. O. Howes, "a wide range of subjects, embracing
among other things, government, dreams, writers of dialect
and dogs"&mdash;Mr. Howes might have heightened his crescendo
by adding "emancipated woman"; and finally&mdash;1909
to 1912&mdash;</i>The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce<i>,
containing all his work previously published in book form,
save the two last mentioned, and much more besides, all collected
and edited by Bierce himself.</i></p>

<p><i>On October 2, 1913, Ambrose Bierce, having settled his
business affairs, left Washington for a trip through the southern
states, declaring in letters his purpose of going into Mexico
and later on to South America. The fullest account of his
trip and his plans is afforded by a newspaper clipping he
sent his niece in a letter dated November 6, 1913; through
the commonplaceness of the reportorial vocabulary shines out
the vivid personality that was making its final exit:</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>"Traveling over the same ground that he had covered with
General Hazen's brigade during the Civil War, Ambrose Bierce,
famed writer and noted critic, has arrived in New Orleans. Not
that this city was one of the places figuring in his campaigns, for
he was here after and not during the war. He has come to New
Orleans in a haphazard, fancy-free way, making a trip toward
Mexico. The places that he has visited on the way down have become<span class="pagenum">xv</span>
famous in song and story&mdash;places where the greatest battles
were fought, where the moon shone at night on the burial corps,
and where in day the sun shone bright on polished bayonets and
the smoke drifted upward from the cannon mouths.</i></p>

<p><i>"For Mr. Bierce was at Chickamauga; he was at Shiloh; at
Murfreesboro; Kenesaw Mountain, Franklin and Nashville.
And then when wounded during the Atlanta campaign he was
invalided home. He 'has never amounted to much since then,' he
said Saturday. But his stories of the great struggle, living as
deathless characterizations of the bloody episodes, stand for what
he 'has amounted to since then.'</i></p>

<p><i>"Perhaps it was in mourning for the dead over whose battlefields
he has been wending his way toward New Orleans that
Mr. Bierce was dressed in black. From head to foot he was
attired in this color, except where the white cuffs and collar
and shirt front showed through. He even carried a walking
cane, black as ebony and unrelieved by gold or silver. But his
eyes, blue and piercing as when they strove to see through the
smoke at Chickamauga, retained all the fire of the indomitable
fighter.</i></p>

<p><i>"'I'm on my way to Mexico, because I like the game,' he said,
'I like the fighting; I want to see it. And then I don't think Americans
are as oppressed there as they say they are, and I want to
get at the true facts of the case. Of course, I'm not going into the
country if I find it unsafe for Americans to be there, but I want to
take a trip diagonally across from northeast to southwest by
horseback, and then take ship for South America, go over the
Andes and across that continent, if possible, and come back to
America again.</i></p>

<p><i>"'There is no family that I have to take care of; I've retired
from writing and I'm going to take a rest. No, my trip isn't for
local color. I've retired just the same as a merchant or business<span class="pagenum">xvi</span>
man retires. I'm leaving the field for the younger authors.'</i></p>

<p><i>"An inquisitive question was interjected as to whether Mr.
Bierce had acquired a competency only from his writings, but he
did not take offense.</i></p>

<p><i>"'My wants are few, and modest,' he said, 'and my royalties
give me quite enough to live on. There isn't much that I need,
and I spend my time in quiet travel. For the last five years I
haven't done any writing. Don't you think that after a man has
worked as long as I have that he deserves a rest? But perhaps
after I have rested I might work some more&mdash;I can't tell, there
are so many things&mdash;' and the straightforward blue eyes took on
a faraway look, 'there are so many things that might happen between
now and when I come back. My trip might take several
years, and I'm an old man now.'</i></p>

<p><i>"Except for the thick, snow-white hair no one would think him
old. His hands are steady, and he stands up straight and tall&mdash;perhaps
six feet."</i></p>
</div>

<p><i>In December of that same year the last letter he is known
to have written was received by his daughter. It is dated
from Chihuahua, and mentions casually that he has attached
himself unofficially to a division of Villa's army, and
speaks of a prospective advance on Ojinaga. No further
word has ever come from or of Ambrose Bierce. Whether
illness overtook him, then an old man of seventy-one, and
death suddenly, or whether, preferring to go foaming over
a precipice rather than to straggle out in sandy deltas, he
deliberately went where he knew death was, no one can say.
His last letters, dauntless, grave, tender, do not say, though
they suggest much. "You must try to forgive my obstinacy
in not 'perishing' where I am," he wrote as he left Washington.<span class="pagenum">xvii</span>
"I want to be where something worth while is going
on, or where nothing whatever is going on." "Good-bye&mdash;if
you hear of my being stood up against a Mexican stone
wall and shot to rags please know that I think that a pretty
good way to depart this life. It beats old age, disease, or falling
down the cellar stairs. To be a Gringo in Mexico&mdash;ah,
that is euthanasia!" Whatever end Ambrose Bierce found
in Mexico, the lines of George Sterling well express what
must have been his attitude in meeting it:</i></p>

<div class="poem">
<p><i>"Dream you he was afraid to live?<br />
<span class="i1">Dream you he was afraid to die?</span><br />
<span class="i1">Or that, a suppliant of the sky,</span><br />

Not thus the shadow-maker stood,<br />

<span class="i1">Be sure he faced the Starless Sky</span><br />
Unduped, unmurmuring, unafraid."</i></p></div>

<p><i>In any consideration of the work of Ambrose Bierce, a central
question must be why it contains so much that is trivial
or ephemeral. Another question facing every critic of Bierce,
is why the fundamentally original point of view, the clarity<span class="pagenum">xviii</span>
of workmanship of his best things&mdash;mainly stories&mdash;did not
win him immediate and general recognition.</i></p>

<p><i>A partial answer to both questions is to be found in a certain
discord between Bierce and his setting. Bierce, paradoxically,
combined the bizarre in substance, the severely
restrained and compressed in form. An ironic mask covered
a deep-seated sensibility; but sensibility and irony were alike
subject to an uncompromising truthfulness; he would have
given deep-throated acclaim to Clough's</i></p>

<p class="poem"><i>
<span class="o1">"But play no tricks upon thy soul, O man,</span><br />
Let truth be truth, and life the thing it can."</i></p>

<p><i>He had the aristocrat's contempt for mass feeling, a selectiveness
carried so far that he instinctively chose for themes
the picked person and experience, the one decisive moment of
crisis. He viewed his characters not in relation to other men
and in normal activities; he isolated them&mdash;often amid abnormalities.</i></p>

<p><i>All this was in sharp contrast to the literary fashion obtaining
when he dipped his pen to try his luck as a creative
artist. The most popular novelist of the day was Dickens;
the most popular poet, Tennyson. Neither looked straight at
life; both veiled it: one in benevolence, the other in beauty.
Direct and painful verities were best tolerated by the reading
public when exhibited as instances of the workings of
natural law. The spectator of the macrocosm in action could
stomach the wanton destruction of a given human atom; one
so privileged could and did excuse the Creator for small mistakes
like harrying Hetty Sorrell to the gallow's foot, because<span class="pagenum">xix</span>
of the conviction that, taking the Universe by and
large, "He was a good fellow, and 'twould all be well."
This benevolent optimism was the offspring of a strange
pair, evangelicism and evolution; and in the minds of the
great public whom Bierce, under other circumstances and
with a slightly different mixture of qualities in himself,
might have conquered, it became a large, soft insincerity
that demanded "happy endings," a profuse broadness of
treatment prohibitive of harsh simplicity, a swathing of
elemental emotion in gentility or moral edification.</i></p>

<p><i>But to Bierce's mind, "noble and nude and antique," this
mid-Victorian draping and bedecking of "unpleasant
truths" was abhorrent. Absolutely direct and unafraid&mdash;not
only in his personal relations but, what is more rare, in
his thinking&mdash;he regarded easy optimism, sure that God is
in his heaven with consequently good effects upon the world,
as blindness, and the hopefulness that demanded always
the "happy ending," as silly. In many significant passages
Bierce's attitude is the ironic one of Voltaire: "'Had not
Pangloss got himself hanged,' replied Candide, 'he would
have given us most excellent advice in this emergency; for
he was a profound philosopher.'" Bierce did not fear to bring
in disconcerting evidence that </i>a priori<i> reasoning may prove
a not infallible guide, that causes do not always produce the
effects complacently pre-argued, and that the notion of this
as the best of all possible worlds is sometimes beside the point.</i></p>

<p><i>The themes permitted by such an attitude were certain to
displease the readers of that period. In </i>Tales of Soldiers<span class="pagenum">xx</span>
and Civilians<i>, his first book of stories, he looks squarely and
grimly at one much bedecked subject of the time&mdash;war; not
the fine gay gallantry of war, the music and the marching
and the romantic episodes; but the ghastly horror of it;
through his vivid, dramatic passages beats a hatred of war,
not merely "unrighteous" war, but all war, the more disquieting
because never allowed to become articulate. With
bitter but beautiful truth he brings each tale to its tragic
close, always with one last turn of the screw, one unexpected
horror more. And in this book&mdash;note the solemn implication
of the title he later gave it, </i>In the Midst of Life<i>&mdash;as well
as in the next, </i>Can Such Things Be<i>, is still another subject
which Bierce alone in his generation seemed unafraid
to consider curiously: "Death, in warfare and in the horrid
guise of the supernatural, was painted over and over. Man's
terror in the face of death gave the artist his cue for his wonderful
physical and psychologic microscopics. You could not
pin this work down as realism, or as romance; it was the
greatest human drama&mdash;the conflict between life and death&mdash;fused
through genius. Not Zola, in the endless pages of his
</i>Debâcle<i>, not the great Tolstoi in his great </i>War and Peace<i>
had ever painted war, horrid war, more faithfully than any
of the stories of this book; not Maupassant had invented out
of war's terrible truths more dramatically imagined plots....
There painted an artist who had seen the thing itself,
and being a genius, had made it an art still greater.</i></p>

<p><i>Death of the young, the beautiful, the brave, was the closing
note of every line of the ten stories of war in this book.<span class="pagenum">xxi</span>
The brilliant, spectacular death that came to such senseless
bravery as Tennyson hymned for the music-hall intelligence
in his </i>Charge of the Light Brigade<i>; the vision-starting,
slow, soul-drugging death by hanging; the multiplied, comprehensible
death that makes rivers near battlefields run
red; the death that comes by sheer terror; death actual and
imagined&mdash;every sort of death was on these pages, so painted
as to make Pierre Loti's </i>Book of Pity and Death<i> seem
but feeble fumbling."</i></p>

<p><i>Now death by the mid-Victorian was considered almost
as undesirable an element in society as sex itself. Both must
be passed over in silence or presented decently draped. In
the eighties any writer who dealt unabashed with death
was regarded as an unpleasant person. "Revolting!" cried
the critics when they read Bierce's </i>Chickamauga<i> and
</i>The Affair at Coulter's Notch<i>.</i></p>

<p><i>Bierce's style, too, by its very fineness, alienated his public.
Superior, keen, perfect in detail, finite, compressed&mdash;such
was his manner in the free and easy, prolix, rambling, multitudinous
nineteenth century.</i></p>

<p><i>Bierce himself knew that although it is always the fashion
to jeer at fashion, its rule is absolute for all that, whether
it be fashion in boots or books.</i></p>

<p><i>"A correspondent of mine," he wrote in 1887 in his </i><span class="smcap">Examiner</span><i>
column, "a well-known and clever writer, appears
surprised because I do not like the work of Robert Louis
Stevenson. I am equally hurt to know that he does. If he was
ever a boy he knows that the year is divided, not into seasons<span class="pagenum">xxii</span>
and months, as is vulgarly supposed, but into 'top time,'
'marble time,' 'kite time,' et cetera, and woe to the boy
who ignores the unwritten calendar, amusing himself according
to the dictates of an irresponsible conscience. I venture
to remind my correspondent that a somewhat similar
system obtains in matters of literature&mdash;a word which I beg
him to observe means fiction. There are, for illustration&mdash;or
rather, there were&mdash;James time, Howells time, Crawford
time, Russell time and Conway time, each epoch&mdash;named for
the immortal novelist of the time being&mdash;lasting, generally
speaking, as much as a year.... All the more rigorous is the
law of observance. It is not permitted to admire Jones in
Smith time. I must point out to my heedless correspondent
that this is not Stevenson time&mdash;that was last year." It was
decidedly not Bierce time when Bierce's stories appeared.</i></p>

<p><i>And there was in him no compromise&mdash;or so he thought.
"A great artist," he wrote to George Sterling, "is superior
to his world and his time, or at least to his parish and his
day." His practical application of that belief is shown in a
letter to a magazine editor who had just rejected a satire he
had submitted:</i></p>

<p><i>"Even </i>you<i> ask for literature&mdash;if my stories are literature,
as you are good enough to imply. (By the way, all the leading
publishers of the country turned down that book until they
saw it published without them by a merchant in San Francisco
and another sort of publishers in London, Leipsig and
Paris.) Well, you wouldn't do a thing to one of my stories!</i></p>

<p><i>"No, thank you; if I have to write rot, I prefer to do it for<span class="pagenum">xxiii</span>
the newspapers, which make no false pretenses and are
frankly rotten, and in which the badness of a bad thing escapes
detection or is forgotten as soon as it is cold.</i></p>

<p><i>"I know how to write a story (of 'happy ending' sort) for
magazine readers for whom literature is too good, but I will
not do so, so long as stealing is more honorable and interesting.
I have offered you ... the best that I am able to make; and
now you must excuse me." In these two utterances we have
some clue to the secret of his having ceased, in 1893, to publish
stories. Vigorously refusing to yield in the slightest degree
to the public so far as his stories were concerned, he
abandoned his best field of creative effort and became almost
exclusively a "columnist" and a satirist; he put his world to
rout, and left his "parish and his day" resplendently the
victors.</i></p>

<p><i>All this must not be taken to mean that the "form and
pressure of the time" put into Bierce what was not there.
Even in his creative work he had a satiric bent; his early
training and associations, too, had been in journalistic satire.
Under any circumstances he undoubtedly would have
written satire&mdash;columns of it for his daily bread, books of
it for self-expression; but under more favorable circumstances
he would have kept on writing other sort of books
as well. Lovers of literature may well lament that Bierce's
insistence on going his way and the demands of his "parish"
forced him to overdevelop one power to the almost complete
paralysis of another and a perhaps finer.</i></p>

<p><i>As a satirist Bierce was the best America has produced,<span class="pagenum">xxiv</span>
perhaps the best since Voltaire. But when he confined himself
to "exploring the ways of hate as a form of creative energy,"
it was with a hurt in his soul, and with some intellectual
and spiritual confusion. There resulted a kink in his
nature, a contradiction that appears repeatedly, not only in
his life, but in his writings. A striking instance is found in
his article </i>To Train a Writer<i>:</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>"He should, for example, forget that he is an American and
remember that he is a man. He should be neither Christian nor
Jew, nor Buddhist, nor Mahometan, nor Snake Worshiper. To
local standards of right and wrong he should be civilly indifferent.
In the virtues, so-called, he should discern only the rough notes
of a general expediency; in fixed moral principles only time-saving
predecisions of cases not yet before the court of conscience. Happiness
should disclose itself to his enlarging intelligence as the end
and purpose of life; art and love as the only means to happiness.
He should free himself of all doctrines, theories, etiquettes, politics,
simplifying his life and mind, attaining clarity with breadth
and unity with height. To him a continent should not seem wide nor
a century long. And it would be needful that he know and have
an ever-present consciousness that this is a world of fools and
rogues, blind with superstition, tormented with envy, consumed
with vanity, selfish, false, cruel, cursed with illusions&mdash;frothing
mad!"</i></p>
</div>

<p><i>Up to that last sentence Ambrose Bierce beholds this world
as one where tolerance, breadth of view, simplicity of life
and mind, clear thinking, are at most attainable, at least
worthy of the effort to attain; he regards life as purposive,
as having happiness for its end, and art and love as the
means to that good end. But suddenly the string from which<span class="pagenum">xxv</span>
he has been evoking these broad harmonies snaps with a
snarl. All is evil and hopeless&mdash;"frothing mad." Both views
cannot be held simultaneously by the same mind. Which was
the real belief of Ambrose Bierce? The former, it seems clear.
But he has been hired to be a satirist.</i></p>

<p><i>On the original fabric of Bierce's mind the satiric strand
has encroached more than the design allows. There results
not only considerable obliteration of the main design, but
confusion in the substituted one. For it is significant that
much of the work of Bierce seems to be that of what he would
have called a futilitarian, that he seldom seems able to find
a suitable field for his satire, a foeman worthy of such perfect
steel as he brings to the encounter; he fights on all fields,
on both sides, against all comers; ubiquitous, indiscriminate,
he is as one who screams in pain at his own futility,
one who "might be heard," as he says of our civilization,
"from afar in space as a scolding and a riot." That Bierce
would have spent so much of his superb power on the trivial
and the ephemeral, breaking magnificent vials of wrath on
Oakland nobodies, preserving insignificant black beetles in
the amber of his art, is not merely, as it has long been, cause
of amazement to the critics; it is cause of laughter to the
gods, and of weeping among Bierce's true admirers.</i></p>

<p><i>Some may argue that Bierce's failure to attain international
or even national fame cannot be ascribed solely to a
lack of concord between the man and his time and to the consequent
reaction in him. It is true that in Bierce's work is a
sort of paucity&mdash;not a mere lack of printed pages, but of the<span class="pagenum">xxvi</span>
fulness of creative activity that makes Byron, for example,
though vulgar and casual, a literary mountain peak. Bierce
has but few themes, few moods; his literary river runs clear
and sparkling, but confined&mdash;a narrow current, not the opulent
stream that waters wide plains of thought and feeling.
Nor has Bierce the power to weave individual entities and
situations into a broad pattern of existence, which is the distinguishing
mark of such writers as Thackeray, Balzac,
and Tolstoi among the great dead, and Bennett and Wells
among the lesser living. Bierce's interest does not lie in the
group experience nor even in the experience of the individual
through a long period. His unit of time is the minute, not the
month. It is significant that he never wrote a novel&mdash;unless
</i>The Monk and the Hangman's Daughter<i> be reckoned
one&mdash;and that he held remarkable views of the novel as a
literary form, witness this passage from </i>Prattle<i>, written in
1887:</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>"English novelists are not great because the English novel is
dead&mdash;deader than Queen Anne at her deadest. The vein is worked
out. It was a thin one and did not 'go down.' A single century from
the time when Richardson sank the discovery shaft it had already
begun to 'pinch out.' The miners of today have abandoned
it altogether to search for 'pockets,' and some of the best of them
are merely 'chloriding the dumps.' To expect another good novel
in English is to expect the gold to 'grow' again."</i></p>
</div>

<p><i>It may well be that at the bottom of this sweeping condemnation
was an instinctive recognition of his own lack
of constructive power on a large scale.</i></p>

<p><i>But an artist, like a nation, should be judged not by what<span class="pagenum">xxvii</span>
he cannot do, but by what he can. That Bierce could not paint
the large canvas does not make him negligible or even inconsiderable.
He is by no means a second-rate writer; he is a
first-rate writer who could not consistently show his first-rateness.</i></p>

<p><i>When he did show his first-rateness, what is it? In all his
best work there is originality, a rare and precious idiosyncracy;
his point of view, his themes are rich with it. Above
all writers Bierce can present&mdash;brilliantly present&mdash;startling
fragments of life, carved out from attendant circumstance;
isolated problems of character and action; sharply
bitten etchings of individual men under momentary stresses
and in bizarre situations. Through his prodigious emotional
perceptivity he has the power of feeling and making us feel
some strange, perverse accident of fate, destructive of the
individual&mdash;of making us feel it to be real and terrible.
This is not an easy thing to do. De Maupassant said that
men were killed every year in Paris by the falling of tiles
from the roof, but if he got rid of a principal character in
that way, he should be hooted at. Bierce can make us accept
as valid and tragic events more odd than the one de Maupassant
had to reject. "In the line of the startling,&mdash;half
Poe, half Merimee&mdash;he cannot have many superiors," says
Arnold Bennett.... "A story like </i>An Occurrence at
Owl Creek Bridge<i>&mdash;well, Edgar Allan Poe might have
deigned to sign it. And that is something.</i></p>

<p><i>"He possesses a remarkable style&mdash;what Kipling's would<span class="pagenum">xxviii</span>
have been had Kipling been born with any significance of the
word 'art'&mdash;and a quite strangely remarkable perception of
beauty. There is a feeling for landscape in </i>A Horseman in
the Sky<i> which recalls the exquisite opening of that indifferent
novel, </i>Les Frères Zemganno<i> by Edmond de Goncourt,
and which no English novelist except Thomas Hardy,
and possibly Charles Marriott, could match." The feeling for
landscape which Bennett notes is but one part of a greater
power&mdash;the power to make concrete and visible, action, person,
place. Bierce's descriptions of Civil War battles in his
</i>Bits of Autobiography<i> are the best descriptions of battle
ever written. He lays out the field with map-like clearness,
marshals men and events with precision and economy, but
his account never becomes exposition&mdash;it is drama. Real
battles move swiftly; accounts make them seem labored and
slow. What narrator save Bierce can convey the sense of
their being lightly swift, and, again and again the shock of
surprise the event itself must have given?</i></p>

<p><i>This could not be were it not for his verbal restraint. In
his descriptions is no welter of adjectives and adverbs;
strong exact nouns and verbs do the work, and this means
that the veritable object and action are brought forward, not
qualifying talk around and about them. And this, again,
could not be were it not for what is, beyond all others, his
greatest quality&mdash;absolute precision. "I sometimes think,"
he once wrote playfully about letters of his having been misunderstood,
"I sometimes think that I am the only man in the
world who understands the meaning of the written word.
Or the only one who does not." A reader of Ambrose Bierce<span class="pagenum">xxix</span>
comes almost to believe that not till now has he found a writer
who understands&mdash;completely&mdash;the meaning of the written
word. He has the power to bring out new meanings in well-worn
words, so setting them as to evoke brilliant significances
never before revealed. He gives to one phrase the
beauty, the compressed suggestion of a poem; his titles&mdash;</i>Black
Beetles in Amber<i>, </i>Ashes of the Beacon<i>, </i>Cobwebs
from an Empty Skull<i> are masterpieces in miniature.
That he should have a gift of coining striking words
naturally follows: in his later years he has fallen into his
"anecdotage," a certain Socialist is the greatest "futilitarian"
of them all, "femininies"&mdash;and so on infinitely. Often
the smaller the Biercean gem, the more exquisite the workmanship.
One word has all the sparkle of an epigram.</i></p>

<p><i>In such skill Ambrose Bierce is not surpassed by any writer,
ancient or modern; it gives him rank among the few masters
who afford that highest form of intellectual delight, the
immediate recognition of a clear idea perfectly set forth in
fitting words&mdash;wit's twin brother, evoking that rare joy, the
sudden, secret laughter of the mind. So much for Bierce the
artist; the man is found in these letters. If further clue to
the real nature of Ambrose Bierce were needed it is to be
found in a conversation he had in his later years with a
young girl: "You must be very proud, Mr. Bierce, of all your
books and your fame?" "No," he answered rather sadly,
"you will come to know that all that is worth while in life
is the love you have had for a few people near to you."</i></p>

<h2><i>A Memoir of Ambrose Bierce</i></h2>
<p class="p2 center"><big><b><i>by </i><span class="smcap">George Sterling</span></b></big></p>
<hr class="c15" />

<p><i>Though from boyhood a lover of tales of the terrible,<span class="pagenum">xxxiii</span>
it was not until my twenty-second year that I heard
of Ambrose Bierce, I having then been for ten
months a resident of Oakland, California. But in the fall of
the year 1891 my friend Roosevelt Johnson, newly arrived
from our town of birth, Sag Harbor, New York, asked me
if I were acquainted with his work, adding that he had been
told that Bierce was the author of stories not inferior in
awesomeness to the most terrible of Poe's.</i></p>

<p><i>We made inquiry and found that Bierce had for several
years been writing columns of critical comment, satirically
named </i>Prattle<i>, for the editorial page of the Sunday
</i><span class="smcap">Examiner</span><i>, of San Francisco. As my uncle, of whose household I
had been for nearly a year a member, did not subscribe to that
journal, I had unfortunately overlooked these weekly contributions
to the wit and sanity of our western literature&mdash;an
omission for which we partially consoled ourselves by subsequently
reading with great eagerness each installment of
</i>Prattle<i> as it appeared. But, so far as his short stories were
concerned, we had to content ourselves with the assurance
of a neighbor that "they'd scare an owl off a tombstone."</i></p>

<p><i>However, later in the autumn, while making a pilgrimage<span class="pagenum">xxxiv</span>
to the home of our greatly worshipped Joaquin Miller, we
became acquainted with Albert, an elder brother of Bierce's,
a man who was to be one of my dearest of friends to the day
of his death, in March, 1914. From him we obtained much
to gratify our not unnatural curiosity as to this mysterious
being, who, from his isolation on a lonely mountain above the
Napa Valley, scattered weekly thunderbolts on the fool, the
pretender, and the knave, and cast ridicule or censure on
many that sat in the seats of the mighty. For none, however
socially or financially powerful, was safe from the stab of
that aculeate pen, the venom of whose ink is to gleam vividly
from the pages of literature for centuries yet to come.</i></p>

<p><i>For Bierce is of the immortals. That fact, known, I think,
to him, and seeming then more and more evident to some of
his admirers, has become plainly apparent to anyone who can
appraise the matter with eyes that see beyond the flimsy artifices
that bulk so large and so briefly in the literary arena.
Bierce was a sculptor who wrought in hardest crystal.</i></p>

<p><i>I was not to be so fortunate as to become acquainted with
him until after the publication of his first volume of short
stories, entitled </i>Tales of Soldiers and Civilians<i>. That mild
title gives scant indication of the terrors that await the unwarned
reader. I recall that I hung fascinated over the book,
unable to lay it down until the last of its printed dooms had
become an imperishable portion of the memory. The tales are
told with a calmness and reserve that make most of Poe's
seem somewhat boyish and melodramatic by comparison.
The greatest of them seems to me to be </i>An Occurrence at<span class="pagenum">xxxv</span>
Owl Creek Bridge<i>, though I am perennially charmed by
the weird beauty of </i>An Inhabitant of Carcosa<i>, a tale of
unique and unforgettable quality.</i></p>

<p><i>Bierce, born in Ohio in 1842, came to San Francisco soon
after the close of the Civil War. It is amusing to learn that
he was one of a family of eleven children, male and female,
the Christian name of each of whom began with the letter
"A!" Obtaining employment at first in the United States
Mint, whither Albert, always his favorite brother, had preceded
him, he soon gravitated to journalism, doing his first
work on the San Francisco </i><span class="smcap">News Letter</span><i>. His brother
once told me that he (Ambrose) had from boyhood been eager
to become a writer and was expectant of success at that pursuit.</i></p>

<p><i>Isolated from most men by the exalted and austere habit
of his thought, Bierce finally suffered a corresponding exile
of the body, and was forced to live in high altitudes, which
of necessity are lonely. This latter banishment was on account
of chronic and utterly incurable asthma, an ailment
contracted in what might almost be termed a characteristic
manner. Bierce had no fear of the dead folk and their marble
city. From occasional strollings by night in Laurel Hill
Cemetery, in San Francisco, his spirit "drank repose," and
was able to attain a serenity in which the cares of daytime
existence faded to nothingness. It was on one of those strolls
that he elected to lie for awhile in the moonlight on a flat
tombstone, and awakening late in the night, found himself
thoroughly chilled, and a subsequent victim of the disease<span class="pagenum">xxxvi</span>
that was to cast so dark a shadow over his following years.
For his sufferings from asthma were terrible, arising often
to a height that required that he be put under the influence
of chloroform.</i></p>

<p><i>So afflicted, he found visits to the lowlands a thing not to
be indulged in with impunity. For many years such trips
terminated invariably in a severe attack of his ailment,
and he was driven back to his heights shaken and harassed.
But he found such visits both necessary and pleasant on
occasion, and it was during one that he made in the summer
of 1892 that I first made his acquaintance, while he was
temporarily a guest at his brother Albert's camp on a rocky,
laurel-covered knoll on the eastern shore of Lake Temescal,
a spot now crossed by the tracks of the Oakland, Antioch
and Eastern Railway.</i></p>

<p><i>I am not likely to forget his first night among us. A tent
being, for his ailment, insufficiently ventilated, he decided
to sleep by the campfire, and I, carried away by my youthful
hero-worship, must partially gratify it by occupying the
side of the fire opposite to him. I had a comfortable cot in my
tent, and was unaccustomed at the time to sleeping on the
ground, the consequence being that I awoke at least every
half-hour. But awake as often as I might, always I found
Bierce lying on his back in the dim light of the embers, his
gaze fixed on the stars of the zenith. I shall not forget the
gaze of those eyes, the most piercingly blue, under yellow
shaggy brows, that I have ever seen.</i></p>

<p><i>After that, I saw him at his brother's home in Berkeley, at<span class="pagenum">xxxvii</span>
irregular intervals, and once paid him a visit at his own
temporary home at Skylands, above Wrights, in Santa Clara
County, whither he had moved from Howell Mountain, in
Napa County. It was on this visit that I was emboldened
to ask his opinion on certain verses of mine, the ambition to
become a poet having infected me at the scandalously mature
age of twenty-six. He was hospitable to my wish, and I was
fortunate enough to be his pupil almost to the year of his
going forth from among us. During the greater part of that
time he was a resident of Washington, D. C., whither he had
gone in behalf of the San Francisco </i><span class="smcap">Examiner</span><i>, to aid in
defeating (as was successfully accomplished) the Funding
Bill proposed by the Southern Pacific Company. It was on
this occasion that he electrified the Senate's committee by
repeatedly refusing to shake the hand of the proponent of
that measure, no less formidable an individual than Collis
P. Huntington.</i></p>

<p><i>For Bierce carried into actual practice his convictions on
ethical matters. Secure in his own self-respect, and valuing
his friendship or approval to a high degree, he refused to
make, as he put it, "a harlot of his friendship." Indeed, he
once told me that it was his rule, on subsequently discovering
the unworth of a person to whom a less fastidious friend
had without previous warning introduced him, to write a
letter to that person and assure him that he regarded the
introduction as a mistake, and that the twain were thenceforth
to "meet as strangers!" He also once informed me that
he did not care to be introduced to persons whom he had<span class="pagenum">xxxviii</span>
criticized, or was about to criticize, in print. "I might get
to like the beggar," was his comment, "and then I'd have
one less pelt in my collection."</i></p>

<p><i>In his criticism of my own work, he seldom used more than
suggestion, realizing, no doubt, the sensitiveness of the tyro
in poetry. It has been hinted to me that he laid, as it were,
a hand of ice on my youthful enthusiasms, but that, to such
extent as it may be true, was, I think, a good thing for a
pupil of the art, youth being apt to gush and become over-sentimental.
Most poets would give much to be able to obliterate
some of their earlier work, and he must have saved
me a major portion of such putative embarrassment. Reviewing
the manuscripts that bear his marginal counsels,
I can now see that such suggestions were all "indicated,"
though at the time I dissented from some of them. It was one
of his tenets that a critic should "keep his heart out of his
head" (to use his own words), when sitting in judgment on
the work of writers whom he knew and liked. But I cannot
but think that he was guilty of sad violations of that
rule, especially in my own case.</i></p>

<p><i>Bierce lived many years in Washington before making
a visit to his old home. That happened in 1910, in which
year he visited me at Carmel, and we afterwards camped
for several weeks together with his brother and nephew,
in Yosemite. I grew to know him better in those days, and
he found us hospitable, in the main degree, to his view of
things, socialism being the only issue on which we were not
in accord. It led to many warm arguments, which, as usual,<span class="pagenum">xxxix</span>
conduced nowhere but to the suspicion that truth in such
matters was mainly a question of taste.</i></p>

<p><i>I saw him again in the summer of 1911, which he spent
at Sag Harbor. We were much on the water, guests of my
uncle in his power-yacht "La Mascotte II." He was a
devotee of canoeing, and made many trips on the warm and
shallow bays of eastern Long Island, which he seemed to
prefer to the less spacious reaches of the Potomac. He revisited
California in the fall of the next year, a trip on which
we saw him for the last time. An excursion to the Grand
Canyon was occasionally proposed, but nothing came of it,
nor did he consent to be again my guest at Carmel, on the
rather surprising excuse that the village contained too many
anarchists! And in November, 1913, I received my last
letter from him, he being then in Laredo, Texas, about to
cross the border into warring Mexico.</i></p>

<p><i>Why he should have gone forth on so hazardous an enterprise
is for the most part a matter of conjecture. It may
have been in the spirit of adventure, or out of boredom, or he
may not, even, have been jesting when he wrote to an intimate
friend that, ashamed of having lived so long, and not
caring to end his life by his own hand, he was going across
the border and let the Mexicans perform for him that service.
But he wrote to others that he purposed to extend his
pilgrimage as far as South America, to cross the Andes,
and return to New York by way of a steamer from Buenos
Ayres. At any rate, we know, from letters written during
the winter months, that he had unofficially attached himself<span class="pagenum">xl</span>
to a section of Villa's army, even taking an active part
in the fighting. He was heard from until the close of 1913;
after that date the mist closes in upon his trail, and we are
left to surmise what we may. Many rumors as to his fate
have come out of Mexico, one of them even placing him in
the trenches of Flanders. These rumors have been, so far as
possible, investigated: all end in nothing. The only one that
seems in the least degree illuminative is the tale brought by
a veteran reporter from the City of Mexico, and published
in the San Francisco </i><span class="smcap">Bulletin</span><i>. It is the story of a soldier in
Villa's army, one of a detachment that captured, near the
village of Icamole, an ammunition train of the Carranzistas.
One of the prisoners was a sturdy, white-haired,
ruddy-faced Gringo, who, according to the tale, went before
the firing squad with an Indian muleteer, as sole companion
in misfortune. The description of the manner&mdash;indifferent, even
contemptuous&mdash;with which the white-haired
man met his death seems so characteristic of Bierce that
one would almost be inclined to give credence to the tale,
impossible though it may be of verification. But the date of
the tragedy being given as late in 1915, it seems incredible
that Bierce could have escaped observation for so long a
period, with so many persons in Mexico eager to know of his
fate. It is far more likely that he met his death at the hands
of a roving band of outlaws or guerrilla soldiery.</i></p>

<p><i>I have had often in mind the vision of his capture by such
a squad, their discovery of the considerable amount of gold
coin that he was known to carry on his person, and his immediate<span class="pagenum">xli</span>
condemnation and execution as a spy in order that
they might retain possession of the booty. Naturally, such
proceedings would not have been reported, from fear of the
necessity of sharing with those "higher up." And so the veil
would have remained drawn, and impenetrable to vision.
Through the efforts of the War Department, all United
States Consuls were questioned as to Bierce's possible departure
from the country; all Americans visiting or residing
in Mexico were begged for information&mdash;even prospectors.
But the story of the reporter is the sole one that seems
partially credible. To such darkness did so shining and fearless
a soul go forth.</i></p>

<p><i>It is now over eight years since that disappearance, and
though the likelihood of his existence in the flesh seems faint
indeed, the storm of detraction and obloquy that he always
insisted would follow his demise has never broken, is not
even on the horizon. Instead, he seems to be remembered with
tolerance by even those whom he visited with a chastening
pen. Each year of darkness but makes the star of his fame
increase and brighten, but we have, I think, no full conception
as yet of his greatness, no adequate realization of
how wide and permanent a fame he has won. It is significant
that some of the discerning admire him for one phase
of his work, some for another. For instance, the clear-headed
H. L. Mencken acclaims him as the first wit of America,
but will have none of his tales; while others, somewhat disconcerted
by the cynicism pervading much of his wit, place
him among the foremost exponents of the art of the short story.<span class="pagenum">xlii</span>
Others again prefer his humor (for he was humorist as
well as wit), and yet others like most the force, clarity and
keen insight of his innumerable essays and briefer comments
on mundane affairs. Personally, I have always regarded
Poe's </i>Fall of the House of Usher<i> as our greatest tale; close
to that come, in my opinion, at least a dozen of Bierce's stories,
whether of the soldier or civilian. He has himself stated
in </i>Prattle<i>: "I am not a poet." And yet he wrote poetry,
on occasion, of a high order, his </i>Invocation<i> being one of the
noblest poems in the tongue. Some of his satirical verse seems
to me as terrible in its withering invective as any that has
been written by classic satirists, not excepting Juvenal and
Swift. Like the victims of their merciless pens, his, too, will
be forgiven and forgotten. Today no one knows, nor cares,
whether or not those long-dead offenders gave just offense.
The grave has closed over accuser and accused, and the only
thing that matters is that a great mind was permitted to
function. One may smile or sigh over the satire, but one must
also realize that even the satirist had his own weaknesses,
and could have been as savagely attacked by a mentality
as keen as his own. Men as a whole will never greatly care
for satire, each recognizing, true enough, glimpses of himself
in the invective, but sensing as well its fundamental
bias and cruelty. However, Bierce thought best of himself
as a satirist.</i></p>

<p><i>Naturally, Bierce carried his wit and humor into his immediate
human relationships. I best recall an occasion,
when, in my first year of acquaintance with him, we were<span class="pagenum">xliii</span>
both guests at the home of the painter, J. H. E. Partington.
It happened that a bowl of nasturtiums adorned the center
table, and having been taught by Father Tabb, the poet,
to relish that flower, I managed to consume most of them
before the close of the evening, knowing there were plenty
more to be had in the garden outside. Someone at last remarked:
"Why, George has eaten all the nasturtiums! Go
out and bring some more." At which Bierce dryly and justly
remarked: "No&mdash;bring some thistles!" It is an indication,
however, of his real kindness of heart that, observing my confusion,
he afterwards apologized to me for what he termed
a thoughtless jest. It was, nevertheless, well deserved.</i></p>

<p><i>I recall even more distinctly a scene of another setting.
This concerns itself with Bierce's son, Leigh, then a youth
in the early twenties. At the time (</i>circa<i> 1894) I was a
brother lodger with them in an Oakland apartment house.
Young Bierce had contracted a liaison with a girl of his
own age, and his father, determined to end the affair, had
appointed an hour for discussion of the matter. The youth
entered his father's rooms defiant and resolute: within an
hour he appeared weeping, and cried out to me, waiting for
him in his own room: "My father is a greater man than
Christ! He has suffered more than Christ!" And the affair
of the heart was promptly terminated.</i></p>

<p><i>One conversant with Bierce only as a controversionalist
and </i>censor morum<i> was, almost of necessity, constrained to
imagine him a misanthrope, a soured and cynical recluse.
Only when one was privileged to see him among his intimates<span class="pagenum">xliv</span>
could one obtain glimpses of his true nature, which
was considerate, generous, even affectionate. Only the waving
of the red flag of Socialism could rouse in him what
seemed to us others a certain savageness of intolerance.
Needless to say, we did not often invoke it, for he was an
ill man with whom to bandy words. It was my hope, at one
time, to involve him and Jack London in a controversy on
the subject, but London declined the oral encounter, preferring
one with the written word. Nothing came of the plan,
which is a pity, as each was a supreme exponent of his point
of view. Bierce subsequently attended one of the midsummer
encampments of the Bohemian Club, of which he was once
the secretary, in their redwood grove near the Russian river.
Hearing that London was present, he asked why they had
not been mutually introduced, and I was forced to tell him
that I feared that they'd be, verbally, at each other's throats,
within an hour. "Nonsense!" exclaimed Bierce. "Bring
him around! I'll treat him like a Dutch Uncle." He kept
his word, and seemed as much attracted to London as London
was to him. But I was always ill at ease when they
were conversing. I do not think the two men ever met again.</i></p>

<p><i>Bierce was the cleanest man, personally, of whom I have
knowledge&mdash;almost fanatically so, if such a thing be possible.
Even during our weeks of camping in the Yosemite, he
would spend two hours on his morning toilet in the privacy
of his tent. His nephew always insisted that the time was
devoted to shaving himself from face to foot! He was also
a most modest man, and I still recall his decided objections<span class="pagenum">xlv</span>
to my bathing attire when at the swimming-pool of the Bohemian
Club, in the Russian River. Compared to many of those
visible, it seemed more than adequate; but he had another
opinion of it. He was a good, even an eminent, tankard-man,
and retained a clear judgment under any amount of potations.
He preferred wine (especially a dry </i>vin du pays<i>, usually
a sauterne) to "hard likker," in this respect differing
in taste from his elder brother. In the days when I first made
his acquaintance, I was accustomed to roam the hills beyond
Oakland and Berkeley from Cordonices Creek to Leona
Heights, in company with Albert Bierce, his son Carlton,
R. L. ("Dick") Partington, Leigh Bierce (Ambrose's surviving
son) and other youths. On such occasions I sometimes
hid a superfluous bottle of port or sherry in a convenient
spot, and Bierce, afterwards accompanying us on several
such outings, pretended to believe that I had such flagons
concealed under each bush or rock in the reach and breadth
of the hills, and would, to carry out the jest, hunt zealously
in such recesses. I could wish that he were less often unsuccessful
in the search, now that he has had "the coal-black
wine" to drink.</i></p>

<p><i>Though an appreciable portion of his satire hints at misanthropy,
Bierce, while profoundly a pessimist, was, by his
own confession to me, "a lover of his country and his fellowmen,"
and was ever ready to proffer assistance in the time
of need and sympathy in the hour of sorrow. His was a great
and tender heart, and giving of it greatly, he expected, or
rather hoped for, a return as great. It may have been by<span class="pagenum">xlvi</span>
reason of the frustration of such hopes that he so often broke
with old and, despite his doubts, appreciative friends. His
brother Albert once told me that he (Ambrose) had never been
"quite the same," after the wound in the head that he received
in the battle of Kenesaw Mountain, but had a tendency
to become easily offended and to show that resentment.
Such estrangements as he and his friends suffered are not,
therefore, matters on which one should sit in judgment. It
is sad to know that he went so gladly from life, grieved and
disappointed. But the white flame of Art that he tended for
nearly half a century was never permitted to grow faint
nor smoky, and it burned to the last with a pure brilliance.
Perhaps, he bore witness to what he had found most admirable
and enduring in life in the following words, the conclusion
of the finest of his essays:</i></p>

<p><i>"Literature and art are about all that the world really
cares for in the end; those who make them are not without
justification in regarding themselves as masters in the House
of Life and all others as their servitors. In the babble and
clamor, the pranks and antics of its countless incapables,
the tremendous dignity of the profession of letters is overlooked;
but when, casting a retrospective eye into 'the dark
backward and abysm of time' to where beyond these voices
is the peace of desolation, we note the majesty of the few
immortals and compare them with the pygmy figures of their
contemporary kings, warriors and men of action generally&mdash;when
across the silent battle-fields and hushed </i>fora<i> where
the dull destinies of nations were determined, nobody cares<span class="pagenum">xlvii</span>
how, we hear</i></p>

<p class="poem"><i>
<span class="i2">like ocean on a western beach</span><br />
The surge and thunder of the Odyssey,</i></p>

<p><i>then we appraise literature at its true value, and how little
worth while seems all else with which Man is pleased to
occupy his fussy soul and futile hands!"</i></p>

</div>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">My dear Blanche</span>,</p>

<p>You will not, I hope, mind my saying that the first part<span class="pagenum">3</span>
of your letter was so pleasing that it almost solved the disappointment
created by the other part. For <i>that</i> is a bit discouraging.
Let me explain.</p>

<p>You receive my suggestion about trying your hand *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
at writing, with assent and apparently pleasure. But, alas,
not for love of the art, but for the purpose of helping God repair
his botchwork world. You want to "reform things," poor
girl&mdash;to rise and lay about you, slaying monsters and liberating
captive maids. You would "help to alter for the better
the position of working-women." You would be a missionary&mdash;and
the rest of it. Perhaps I shall not make myself
understood when I say that this discourages me; that in such
aims (worthy as they are) I would do nothing to assist you;
that such ambitions are not only impracticable but incompatible
with the spirit that gives success in art; that such
ends are a prostitution of art; that "helpful" writing is
dull reading. If you had had more experience of life I should
regard what you say as entirely conclusive against your
possession of any talent of a literary kind. But you are
so young and untaught in that way&mdash;and I have the
testimony of little felicities and purely literary touches
(apparently unconscious) in your letters&mdash;perhaps your
unschooled heart and hope should not be held as having<span class="pagenum">4</span>
spoken the conclusive word. But surely, my child&mdash;as
surely as anything in mathematics&mdash;Art will laurel no
brow having a divided allegiance. Love the world as much
as you will, but serve it otherwise. The best service you
can perform by writing is to write well with no care for
anything but that. Plant and water and let God give the
increase if he will, and to whom it shall please him.</p>

<p>Suppose your father were to "help working-women" by
painting no pictures but such (of their ugly surroundings,
say) as would incite them to help themselves, or others to
help them. Suppose you should play no music but such as&mdash;but
I need go no further. Literature (I don't mean journalism)
is an <i>art</i>;&mdash;it is not a form of benevolence. It has nothing
to do with "reform," and when used as a means of reform
suffers accordingly and justly. Unless you can <i>feel</i> that way
I cannot advise you to meddle with it.</p>

<p>It would be dishonest in me to accept your praise for
what I wrote of the Homestead Works quarrel&mdash;unless
you should praise it for being well written and true. I have
no sympathies with that savage fight between the two
kinds of rascals, and no desire to assist either&mdash;except to
better hearts and manners. The love of truth is good
enough motive for me when I write of my fellowmen. I
like many things in this world and a few persons&mdash;I like
you, for example; but after they are served I have no love
to waste upon the irreclaimable mass of brutality that we
know as "mankind." Compassion, yes&mdash;I am sincerely
sorry that they are brutes.</p>

<p>Yes, I wrote the article "The Human Liver." Your criticism
is erroneous. My opportunities of knowing women's
feelings toward Mrs. Grundy are better than yours. They
hate her with a horrible antipathy; but they cower all the<span class="pagenum">5</span>
same. The fact that they are a part of her mitigates neither
their hatred nor their fear.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>After next Monday I shall probably be in St. Helena, but
if you will be so good as still to write to me please address
me here until I apprise you of my removal; for I shall intercept
my letters at St. Helena, wherever addressed. And
maybe you will write before Monday. I need not say how
pleasant it is for me to hear from you. And I shall want to
know what you think of what I say about your "spirit of
reform."</p>

<p>How I should have liked to pass that Sunday in camp
with you all. And to-day&mdash;I wonder if you are there to-day.
I feel a peculiar affection for that place.</p>

<p>Please give my love to all your people, and forgive my
intolerably long letters&mdash;or retaliate in kind.</p>

<p class="left65">Sincerely your friend,<span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">I know, dear Blanche</span>, of the disagreement among men
as to the nature and aims of literature; and the subject is
too "long" to discuss. I will only say that it seems to me
that men holding Tolstoi's view are not properly literary
men (that is to say, artists) at all. They are "missionaries,"
who, in their zeal to lay about them, do not scruple
to seize any weapon that they can lay their hands on; they
would grab a crucifix to beat a dog. The dog is well beaten,
no doubt (which makes him a worse dog than he was before)
but note the condition of the crucifix! The work of
these men is better, of course, than the work of men of
truer art and inferior brains; but always you see the possibilities&mdash;possibilities<span class="pagenum">6</span>
to <i>them</i>&mdash;which they have missed or
consciously sacrificed to their fad. And after all they do no
good. The world does not wish to be helped. The poor wish
only to be rich, which is impossible, not to be better. They
would like to be rich in order to be worse, generally speaking.
And your working woman (also generally speaking)
does not wish to be virtuous; despite her insincere deprecation
she would not let the existing system be altered if
she could help it. Individual men and women can be
assisted; and happily some are worthy of assistance. No
<i>class</i> of mankind, no tribe, no nation is worth the sacrifice
of one good man or woman; for not only is their average
worth low, but they like it that way; and in trying to help
them you fail to help the good individuals. Your family,
your immediate friends, will give you scope enough for all
your benevolence. I must include your<i>self</i>.</p>

<p>In timely illustration of some of this is an article by Ingersoll
in the current <i>North American Review</i>&mdash;I shall send
it you. It will be nothing new to you; the fate of the philanthropist
who gives out of his brain and heart instead of
his pocket&mdash;having nothing in that&mdash;is already known to
you. It serves him richly right, too, for his low taste in loving.
He who dilutes, spreads, subdivides, the love which naturally
<i>all</i> belongs to his family and friends (if they are good)
should not complain of non-appreciation. Love those, help
those, whom from personal knowledge you know to be worthy.
To love and help others is treason to <i>them</i>. But, bless my
soul! I did not mean to say all this.</p>

<p>But while you seem clear as to your own art, you seem
undecided as to the one you wish to take up. I know the
strength and sweetness of the illusions (that is, <i>de</i>lusions)
that you are required to forego. I know the abysmal ignorance
of the world and human character which, as a girl,<span class="pagenum">7</span>
you necessarily have. I know the charm that inheres in the
beckoning of the Britomarts, as they lean out of their
dream to persuade you to be as like them as is compatible
with the fact that you exist. But I believe, too, that if you
are set thinking&mdash;not reading&mdash;you will find the light.</p>

<p>You ask me of journalism. It is so low a thing that it <i>may</i>
be legitimately used as a means of reform or a means of
anything deemed worth accomplishing. It is not an art;
art, except in the greatest moderation, is damaging to it.
The man who can write well must not write as well as he
can; the others may, of course. Journalism has many purposes,
and the people's welfare <i>may</i> be one of them; though
that is not the purpose-in-chief, by much.</p>

<p>I don't mind your irony about my looking upon the unfortunate
as merely "literary material." It is true in so
far as I consider them <i>with reference to literature</i>. Possibly
I might be willing to help them otherwise&mdash;as your father
might be willing to help a beggar with money, who is not
picturesque enough to go into a picture. As you might be
willing to give a tramp a dinner, yet unwilling to play "The
Sweet Bye-and-Bye," or "Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay," to tickle
his ear.</p>

<p>You call me "master." Well, it is pleasant to think of
you as a pupil, but&mdash;you know the young squire had to
watch his arms all night before the day of his accolade and
investiture with knighthood. I think I'll ask you to contemplate
yours a little longer before donning them&mdash;not
by way of penance but instruction and consecration. When
you are quite sure of the nature of your <i>call</i> to write&mdash;quite
sure that it is <i>not</i> the voice of "duty"&mdash;then let me
do you such slight, poor service as my limitations and the
injunctions of circumstance permit. In a few ways I can<span class="pagenum">8</span>
help you.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Since coming here I have been ill all the time, but it
seems my duty to remain as long as there is a hope that I
<i>can</i> remain. If I get free from my disorder and the fear of it
I shall go down to San Francisco some day and then try to
see your people and mine. Perhaps you would help me to
find my brother's new house&mdash;if he is living in it.</p>

<p>With sincere regards to all your family, I am most truly
your friend,<span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

<p>Your letters are very pleasing to me. I think it nice of you
to write them.</p>

<p>My health is bad again, and I fear that I shall have to
abandon my experiment of living here, and go back to the

<p>You asked me what books would be useful to you&mdash;I'm
assuming that you've repented your sacrilegious attitude
toward literature, and will endeavor to thrust your pretty
head into the crown of martyrdom otherwise. I may mention
a few from time to time as they occur to me. There is
a little book entitled (I think) simply "English Composition."
It is by Prof. John Nichol&mdash;elementary, in a few
places erroneous, but on the whole rather better than the
ruck of books on the same subject.</p>

<p>Read Longinus, Herbert Spencer on Style, Pope's "Essay
on Criticism" (don't groan&mdash;the detractors of Pope are not
always to have things their own way), Lucian on the writing<span class="pagenum">9</span>
of history&mdash;though you need not write history. Read
poor old obsolete Kames' notions; some of them are not half
bad. Read Burke "On the Sublime and Beautiful."</p>

<p>Read&mdash;but that will do at present. And as you read don't
forget that the rules of the literary art are deduced from
the work of the masters who wrote in ignorance of them or
in unconsciousness of them. That fixes their value; it is
secondary to that of <i>natural</i> qualifications. None the less,
it is considerable. Doubtless you have read many&mdash;perhaps
most&mdash;of these things, but to read them with a view
to profit <i>as a writer</i> may be different. If I could get to San
Francisco I could dig out of those artificial memories, the
catalogues of the libraries, a lot of titles additional&mdash;and
get you the books, too. But I've a bad memory, and am
out of the Book Belt.</p>

<p>I wish you would write some little thing and send it me
for examination. I shall not judge it harshly, for this I
<i>know</i>: the good writer (supposing him to be born to the
trade) is not made by reading, but by observing and experiencing.
You have lived so little, seen so little, that your
range will necessarily be narrow, but within its lines I
know no reason why you should not do good work. But it
is all conjectural&mdash;you may fail. Would it hurt if I should
tell you that I thought you had failed? Your absolute and
complete failure would not affect in the slightest my
admiration of your intellect. I have always half suspected
that it is only second rate minds, and minds below the
second rate, that hold their cleverness by so precarious a
tenure that they can detach it for display in words.</p>

<p>I positively shall not bore you with an interminated
screed this time. But I thought you might like to know
that I have recovered my health, and hope to be able to
remain here for a few months at least. And if I remain well
long enough to make me reckless I shall visit your town
some day, and maybe ask your mother to command you
to let me drive you to Berkeley. It makes me almost sad
to think of the camp at the lake being abandoned.</p>

<p>So you liked my remarks on the "labor question." That
is nice of you, but aren't you afraid your praise will get me
into the disastrous literary habit of writing for some <i>one</i>
pair of eyes?&mdash;your eyes? Or in resisting the temptation I
may go too far in the opposite error. But you do not see
that it is "Art for Art's sake"&mdash;hateful phrase! Certainly
not, it is not Art at all. Do you forget the distinction I
pointed out between journalism and literature? Do you
not remember that I told you that the former was of so
little value that it might be used for anything? My newspaper
work is in <i>no</i> sense literature. It is nothing, and only
becomes something when I give it the very use to which I
would put nothing literary. (Of course I refer to my editorial
and topical work.)</p>

<p>If you want to learn to write that kind of thing, so as to
do good with it, you've an easy task. <i>Only</i> it is not worth
learning and the good that you can do with it is not worth
doing. But literature&mdash;the desire to do good with <i>that</i> will
not help you to your means. It is not a sufficient incentive.
The Muse will not meet you if you have any work for her
to do. Of course I sometimes like to do good&mdash;who does
not? And sometimes I am glad that access to a great number
of minds every week gives me an opportunity. But,
thank Heaven, I don't make a business of it, nor use in it<span class="pagenum">11</span>
a tool so delicate as to be ruined by the service.</p>

<p>Please do not hesitate to send me anything that you may
be willing to write. If you try to make it perfect before you
let me see it, it will never come. My remarks about the
kind of mind which holds its thoughts and feelings by so
precarious a tenure that they are detachable for use by
others were not made with a forethought of your failure.</p>

<p>Mr. Harte of the New England Magazine seems to want
me to know his work (I asked to) and sends me a lot of it
cut from the magazine. I pass it on to you, and most of it
is just and true.</p>

<p>But I'm making another long letter.</p>

<p>I wish I were not an infidel&mdash;so that I could say: "God
bless you," and mean it literally. I wish there <i>were</i> a God
to bless you, and that He had nothing else to do.</p>

<p>Please let me hear from you. Sincerely,<span class="flright">A. B.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">My dear Blanche</span>,</p>

<p>I have been waiting for a full hour of leisure to write you
a letter, but I shall never get it, and so I'll write you anyhow.
Come to think of it, there is nothing to say&mdash;nothing
that <i>needs</i> be said, rather, for there is always so much that
one would like to say to you, best and most patient of
<i>sayees</i>.</p>

<p>I'm sending you and your father copies of my book. Not
that I think you (either of you) will care for that sort of
thing, but merely because your father is my co-sinner in
making the book, and you in sitting by and diverting my
mind from the proof-sheets of a part of it. Your part, therefore,
in the work is the typographical errors. So you are in
literature in spite of yourself.</p>

<p>I appreciate what you write of my girl. She is the best of<span class="pagenum">12</span>
girls to me, but God knoweth I'm not a proper person to
direct her way of life. However, it will not be for long. A
dear friend of mine&mdash;the widow of another dear friend&mdash;in
London wants her, and means to come out here next
spring and try to persuade me to let her have her&mdash;for a
time at least. It is likely that I shall. My friend is wealthy,
childless and devoted to both my children. I wish that in
the meantime she (the girl) could have the advantage of
association with <i>you</i>.</p>

<p>Please say to your father that I have his verses, which I
promise myself pleasure in reading.</p>

<p><i>You</i> appear to have given up your ambition to "write
things." I'm sorry, for "lots" of reasons&mdash;not the least
being the selfish one that I fear I shall be deprived of a
reason for writing you long dull letters. Won't you <i>play</i>
at writing things?</p>

<p>My (and Danziger's) book, "The Monk and the Hangman's
Daughter," is to be out next month. The Publisher&mdash;I
like to write it with a reverent capital letter&mdash;is unprofessional
enough to tell me that he regards it as the very
best piece of English composition that he ever saw, and he
means to make the world know it. Now let the great English
classics hide their diminished heads and pale their
ineffectual fires!</p>

<p>So you begin to suspect that books do not give you the
truth of life and character. Well, that suspicion is the beginning
of wisdom, and, so far as it goes, a preliminary
qualification for writing&mdash;books. Men and women are
certainly not what books represent them to be, nor what
<i>they</i> represent&mdash;and sometimes believe&mdash;themselves to be.
They are better, they are worse, and far more interesting.</p>

<p>With best regards to all your people, and in the hope that<span class="pagenum">13</span>
we may frequently hear from you, I am very sincerely your
friend,<span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

<p>Both the children send their <i>love</i> to you. And they mean
just that.</p>

you for an idle hour.</p>

<p>I have so far recovered my health that I hope to do a
little pot-boiling to-morrow. (Is that properly written with
a hyphen?&mdash;for the life o' me I can't say, just at this
moment. There is a story of an old actor who having
played one part half his life had to cut out the name of the
person he represented wherever it occurred in his lines: he
could never remember which syllable to accent.) My illness
was only asthma, which, unluckily, does not kill me

<p>Dr. Danziger writes that he has ordered your father's sketch
sent me. And I've ordered a large number of extra impressions
of it&mdash;if it is still on the stone. So you see I like it.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Partington</span>,</p>

<p>I've been too ill all the week to write you of your manuscripts,
or even read them understandingly.</p>

<p>I think "Honest Andrew's Prayer" far and away the
best. <i>It</i> is witty&mdash;the others hardly more than earnest,
and not, in my judgment, altogether fair. But then you
know you and I would hardly be likely to agree on a point<span class="pagenum">14</span>
of that kind,&mdash;I refuse my sympathies in some directions
where I extend my sympathy&mdash;if that is intelligible. You,
I think, have broader sympathies than mine&mdash;are not only
sorry for the Homestead strikers (for example) but approve
them. I do not. But we are one in detesting their
oppressor, the smug-wump, Carnegie.</p>

<p>If you had not sent "Honest Andrew's Prayer" elsewhere
I should try to place it here. It is so good that I hope
to see it in print. If it is rejected please let me have it again
if the incident is not then ancient history.</p>

<p>I'm glad you like some things in my book. But you should
not condemn me for debasing my poetry with abuse; you
should commend me for elevating my abuse with a little
poetry, here and there. I am not a poet, but an abuser&mdash;that
makes all the difference. It is "how you look at it."</p>

<p>But I'm still too ill to write. With best regards to all your
family, I am sincerely yours, <span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

<p>I've been reading your pamphlet on Art Education. You
write best when you write most seriously&mdash;and your best
is very good.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Dear Blanche</span>,</p>

<p>I send you this picture in exchange for the one that you
have&mdash;I'm "redeeming" all those with these. But I asked
you to return that a long time ago. Please say if you like
this; to me it looks like a dude. But I hate the other&mdash;the
style of it.</p>

<p>It is very good of your father to take so much trouble as
to go over and work on that stone. I want the pictures&mdash;lithographs&mdash;only
for economy: so that when persons for
whom I do not particularly care want pictures of me I
need not bankrupt myself in orders to the photographer.<span class="pagenum">15</span>
And I do not like photographs anyhow. How long, O Lord,
how long am I to wait for that sketch of <i>you</i>?</p>

<p>My dear girl, I do not see that folk like your father and
me have any just cause of complaint against an unappreciative
world; nobody compels us to make things that the
world does not want. We merely choose to because the
pay, <i>plus</i> the satisfaction, exceeds the pay alone that we
get from work that the world does want. Then where is our
grievance? We get what we prefer when we do good work;
for the lesser wage we do easier work. It has never seemed
to me that the "unappreciated genius" had a good case to
go into court with, and I think he should be promptly non-suited.
Inspiration from Heaven is all very fine&mdash;the
mandate of an attitude or an instinct is good; but when A
works for B, yet insists on taking his orders from C, what
can he expect? So don't distress your good little heart with
compassion&mdash;not for me, at least; whenever I tire of pot-boiling,
wood-chopping is open to me, and a thousand other
honest and profitable employments.</p>

<p>I have noted Gertrude's picture in the Examiner with a
peculiar interest. That girl has a bushel of brains, and her
father and brother have to look out for her or she will leave
them out of sight. I would suggest as a measure of precaution
against so monstrous a perversion of natural order that
she have her eyes put out. The subjection of women must
be maintained.</p>

<p>I am glad you will consent to tolerate the new photograph&mdash;all
my other friends are desperately delighted with
it. I prefer your tolerance.</p>

<p>But I don't like to hear that you have been "ill and
blue"; that is a condition which seems more naturally to
appertain to me. For, after all, whatever cause you may
have for "blueness," you can always recollect that you are
<i>you</i>, and find a wholesome satisfaction in your identity;
whereas I, alas, am <i>I</i>!</p>

<p>I'm sure you performed your part of that concert creditably
despite the ailing wrist, and wish that I might have
added myself to your triumph.</p>

<p>I have been very ill again but hope to get away from here
(back to my mountain) before it is time for another attack
from my friend the enemy. I shall expect to see you there
sometime when my brother and his wife come up. They
would hardly dare to come without you.</p>

<p>No, I did not read the criticism you mention&mdash;in the
<i>Saturday Review</i>. Shall send you all the <i>Saturdays</i> that I
get if you will have them. Anyhow, they will amuse (and
sometimes disgust) your father.</p>

<p>I have awful arrears of correspondence, as usual.</p>

<p>The children send love. They had a pleasant visit with
Carlt, and we hope he will come again.</p>

<p>May God be very good to you and put it into your heart
to write to your uncle often.</p>

<p>Only just a word to say that I have repented of my assent
to your well-meant proposal for your father to write of <i>me</i>.<span class="pagenum">17</span>
If there is anything in my work in letters that engages his
interest, or in my <i>literary</i> history&mdash;that is well enough, and
I shall not mind. But "biography" in the other sense is
distasteful to me. I never read biographical "stuff" of
other writers&mdash;of course you know "stuff" is literary
slang for "matter"&mdash;and think it "beside the question."
Moreover, it is distinctly mischievous to letters. It throws
no light on one's work, but on the contrary "darkens
counsel." The only reason that posterity judges work with
some slight approach to accuracy is that posterity knows
less, and cares less, about the author's personality. It considers
his work as impartially as if it had found it lying
on the ground with no footprints about it and no initials
on its linen.</p>

<p>My brother is not "fully cognizant" of my history, anyhow&mdash;not
of the part that is interesting.</p>

<p>So, on the whole, I'll ask that it be not done. It was only
my wish to please that made me consent. That wish is no
weaker now, but I would rather please otherwise.</p>

<p>I trust that you arrived safe and well, and that your
memory of those few stormy days is not altogether disagreeable.

<p>Returning here from the city this morning, I find your
letter. And I had not replied to your last one before that!
But <i>that</i> was because I hoped to see you at your home. I
was unable to do so&mdash;I saw no one (but Richard) whom I
really wanted to see, and had not an hour unoccupied by
work or "business" until this morning. And then&mdash;it was
Christmas, and my right to act as skeleton at anybody's
feast by even so much as a brief call was not clear. I hope<span class="pagenum">18</span>
my brother will be as forgiving as I know you will be.</p>

<p>When I went down I was just recovering from as severe
an attack of illness as I ever had in my life. Please consider
unsaid all that I have said in praise of this mountain,
its air, water, and everything that is its.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>It was uncommonly nice of Hume to entertain so good an
opinion of me; if you had seen him a few days later you
would have found a different state of affairs, probably; for
I had been exhausting relays of vials of wrath upon him
for delinquent diligence in securing copyright for my little
story&mdash;whereby it is uncopyrighted. I ought to add that
he has tried to make reparation, and is apparently contrite
to the limit of his penitential capacity.</p>

<p>No, there was no other foundation for the little story
than its obvious naturalness and consistency with the
sentiments "appropriate to the season." When Christendom
is guzzling and gorging and clowning it has not time
to cease being cruel; all it can do is to augment its hypocrisy
a trifle.</p>

<p>Please don't lash yourself and do various penances any
more for your part in the plaguing of poor Russell; he is
quite forgotten in the superior affliction sent upon James
Whitcomb Riley. <i>That</i> seems a matter of genuine public
concern, if I may judge by what I heard in town (and I
heard little else) and by my letters and "esteemed"
(though testy) "contemporaries." Dear, dear, how sensitive
people are becoming!</p>

<p>Richard has promised me the Blanchescape that I have
so patiently waited for while you were practicing the art of
looking pretty in preparation for the sitting, so now I am
happy. I shall put you opposite Joaquin Miller, who is<span class="pagenum">19</span>
now framed and glazed in good shape. I have also your
father's sketch of me&mdash;that is, I got it and left it in San
Francisco to be cleaned if possible; it was in a most unregenerate
state of dirt and grease.</p>

<p>Seeing Harry Bigelow's article in the <i>Wave</i> on women
who write (and it's unpleasantly near to the truth of the
matter) I feel almost reconciled to the failure of my gorgeous
dream of making a writer of <i>you</i>. I wonder if you
would have eschewed the harmless, necessary tub and
danced upon the broken bones of the innocuous toothbrush.
Fancy you with sable nails and a soiled cheek,
uttering to the day what God taught in the night! Let us
be thankful that the peril is past.</p>

<p>The next time I go to "the Bay" I shall go to 1019 <i>first</i>.</p>

<p>God bless you for a good girl.<span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

<p class="p4">[First part of this letter missing.]</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Yes, I know Blackburn Harte has a weakness for the proletariat
of letters *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and doubtless thinks Riley good
<i>because</i> he is "of the people," peoply. But he will have to
endure me as well as he can. You ask my opinion of Burns.
He has not, I think, been translated into English, and I do
not (that is, I can but <i>will</i> not) read that gibberish. I read
Burns once&mdash;that was once too many times; but happily
it was before I knew any better, and so my time, being
worthless, was not wasted.</p>

<p>I wish you could be up here this beautiful weather. But
I dare say it would rain if you came. In truth, it is "thickening"
a trifle just because of my wish. And I wish I <i>had</i>
given you, for your father, all the facts of my biography<span class="pagenum">20</span>
from the cradle&mdash;downward. When you come again I
shall, if you still want them. For I'm worried half to death
with requests for them, and when I refuse am no doubt
considered surly or worse. And my refusal no longer serves,
for the biography men are beginning to write my history
from imagination. So the next time I see you I shall give
you (orally) that "history of a crime," my life. Then, if
your father is still in the notion, he can write it from your
notes, and I can answer all future inquiries by enclosing
his article.</p>

<p>Do you know?&mdash;you will, I think, be glad to know&mdash;that
I have many more offers for stories at good prices,
than I have the health to accept. (For I am less nearly well
than I have told you.) Even the <i>Examiner</i> has "waked
up" (I woke it up) to the situation, and now pays me $20 a
thousand words; and my latest offer from New York is $50.</p>

<p>I hardly know why I tell you this unless it is because you
tell me of any good fortune that comes to your people, and
because you seem to take an interest in my affairs such as
nobody else does in just the same unobjectionable and, in
fact, agreeable way. I wish you were my "real, sure-enough"
niece. But in that case I should expect you to pass
all your time at Howell Mountain, with your uncle and
cousin. Then I should teach you to write, and you could
expound to me the principles underlying the art of being
the best girl in the world. Sincerely yours, <span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

as I have to go to work on Friday, <i>sure</i>, I may as well practice

<p>You see the matter is this way. You can't come up here
and go back the same day&mdash;at least that would give you
but about an hour here. You must remain over night. Now
I put it to you&mdash;how do you think I'd feel if you came and
remained over night and I, having work to do, should have
to leave you to your own devices, mooning about a place
that has nobody to talk to? When a fellow comes a long
way to see me I want to see a good deal of him, however <i>he</i>
may feel about it. It is not the same as if he lived in the
same bailiwick and "dropped in." That is why, in the present
state of my health and work, I ask all my friends to
give me as long notice of their coming as possible. I'm sure
you'll say I am right, inasmuch as certain work if undertaken
must be done by the time agreed upon.</p>

<p>My relations with Danziger are peculiar&mdash;as any one's
relations with him must be. In the matter of which you

you to believe there are reasons. It would not have been
fair not to let you know, before coming, that I would not
talk of him.</p>

<p>I thought, though, that you would probably come up to-day
if I wrote you. Well, I should like you to come and pass
a week with me. But if you come for a day I naturally want
it to be an "off" day with me. Sincerely yours,<span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

<p>I should have written you sooner; it has been ten whole
days since the date of your last letter. But I have not been
in the mood of letter writing, and am prepared for maledictions
from all my neglected friends but you. My
health is better. Yesterday I returned from Napa, where I
passed twenty-six hours, buried, most of the time, in fog;
but apparently it has not harmed me. The weather here
remains heavenly. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>If I grow better in health I shall in time feel able to extend
my next foray into the Lowlands as far as Oakland
and Berkeley.</p>

<p>Here are some fronds of maiden-hair fern that I have just
brought in. The first wild flowers of the season are beginning
to venture out and the manzanitas are a sight to see.</p>

<p>What an admirable reporter you would be! Your account
of the meeting with Miller in the restaurant and of the
"entertainment" are amusing no end. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* By the way,
I observe a trooly offle "attack" on me in the Oakland<span class="pagenum">23</span>
<i>Times</i> of the 3rd (I think) *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* (I know of course it
means me&mdash;I always know that when they pull out of
their glowing minds that old roasted chestnut about
"tearing down" but not "building up"&mdash;that is to say,
effacing one imposture without giving them another in
place of it.) The amusing part of the business is that he
points a contrast between me and Realf (God knows
there's unlikeness enough) quite unconscious of the fact
that it is I and no other who have "built up" Realf's reputation
as a poet&mdash;published his work, and paid him for it,
when nobody else would have it; repeatedly pointed out its
greatness, and when he left that magnificent crown of sonnets
behind him protested that posterity would know California
better by the incident of his death than otherwise&mdash;not
a soul, until now, concurring in my view of the verses.
Believe me, my trade is not without its humorous side.</p>

<p>Leigh and I went down to the waterfall yesterday. It was
almost grand&mdash;greater than I had ever seen it&mdash;and I
took the liberty to wish that you might see it in that state.
My wish must have communicated itself, somehow, though
imperfectly, to Leigh, for as I was indulging it he expressed
the same wish with regard to Richard.</p>

<p>I wish too that you might be here to-day to see the swirls
of snow. It is falling rapidly, and I'm thinking that this
letter will make its way down the mountain to-morrow
morning through a foot or two of it. Unluckily, it has a
nasty way of turning to rain.</p>

<p>My health is very good now, and Leigh and I take long
walks. And after the rains we look for Indian arrow-heads
in the plowed fields and on the gravel bars of the creek. My
collection is now great; but I fear I shall tire of the fad
before completing it. One in the country must have a fad<span class="pagenum">24</span>
or die of dejection and oxidation of the faculties. How happy
is he who can make a fad of his work!</p>

<p>By the way, my New York publishers (The United States
Book Company) have failed, owing me a pot of money, of
which I shall probably get nothing. I'm beginning to cherish
an impertinent curiosity to know what Heaven means to do
to me next. If your function as one of the angels gives you
a knowledge of such matters please betray your trust and
tell me where I'm to be hit, and how hard.</p>

<p>But this is an intolerable deal of letter.</p>

<p>With best regards to all good Partingtons&mdash;and I think
there are no others&mdash;I remain your affectionate uncle by
adoption, <span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

<p>Leigh has brought in some manzanita blooms which I
shall try to enclose. But they'll be badly smashed.</p>

<p>I thank you many times for the picture, which is a monstrous
good picture, whatever its shortcomings as a portrait
may be. On the authority of the great art critic, Leigh
Bierce, I am emboldened to pronounce some of the work
in it equal to Gribayedoff at his best; and that, according
to the g. a. c. aforesaid, is to exhaust eulogium. But&mdash;it
isn't altogether the Blanche that I know, as I know her.
Maybe it is the hat&mdash;I should prefer you hatless, and so
less at the mercy of capricious fortune. Suppose hats were
to "go out"&mdash;I tremble to think of what would happen to
that gorgeous superstructure which now looks so beautiful.
O, well, when I come down I shall drag you to the hateful
photographer and get something that looks quite like
you&mdash;and has no other value.</p>

<p>And I mean to "see Oakland and die" pretty soon. I have<span class="pagenum">25</span>
not dared go when the weather was bad. It promises well
now, but I am to have visitors next Sunday, so must stay
at home. God and the weather bureau willing, you may be
bothered with me the Saturday or Sunday after. We shall see.</p>

<p>I hope your father concurs in my remarks on picture
"borders"&mdash;I did not think of him until the remarks had
been written, or I should have assured myself of his practice
before venturing to utter my mind o' the matter. If it
were not for him and Gertrude and the <i>Wave</i> I should
snarl again, anent "half-tones," which I abhor. Hume tried
to get me to admire his illustrations, but I would not, so far
as the process is concerned, and bluntly told him he would
not get your father's best work that way.</p>

<p>If you were to visit the Mountain now I should be able
to show you a redwood forest (newly discovered) and a
picturesque gulch to match.</p>

<p>The wild flowers are beginning to put up their heads to
look for you, and my collection of Indian antiquities is
yearning to have you see it.</p>

<p>Please convey my thanks to Richard for the picture&mdash;the
girlscape&mdash;and my best regards to your father and all
the others.</p>

<p>I'm very sorry indeed that I cannot be in Oakland Thursday
evening to see you "in your glory," arrayed, doubtless,
like a lily of the field. However glorious you may be in
public, though, I fancy I should like you better as you used
to be out at camp.</p>

<p>Well, I mean to see you on Saturday afternoon if you are
at home, and think I shall ask you to be my guide to<span class="pagenum">26</span>
Grizzlyville; for surely I shall never be able to find the
wonderful new house alone. So if your mamma will let you
go out there with me I promise to return you to her instead
of running away with you. And, possibly, weather
permitting, we can arrange for a Sunday in the redwoods
or on the hills. Or don't your folks go out any more o'
Sundays?</p>

<p>Please give my thanks to your mother for the kind invitation
to put up at your house; but I fear that would be
impossible. I shall have to be where people can call on me&mdash;and
such a disreputable crowd as my friends are would ruin
the Partingtonian reputation for respectability. In your new
neighborhood you will all be very proper&mdash;which you could
hardly be with a procession of pirates and vagrants pulling
at your door-bell.</p>

<p>So&mdash;if God is good&mdash;I shall call on you Saturday afternoon.
In the meantime and always be thou happy&mdash;thou
and thine. Your unworthy uncle, <span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

<p>It is good to have your letters again. If you will not let
me teach you my trade of writing stories it is right that you
practice your own of writing letters. You are mistress of
that. Byron's letters to Moore are dull in comparison with
yours to me. Some allowance, doubtless, must be made for
my greater need of your letters than of Byron's. For, truth
to tell, I've been a trifle dispirited and noncontent. In that
mood I peremptorily resigned from the <i>Examiner</i>, for one
thing&mdash;and permitted myself to be coaxed back by Hearst,
for another. My other follies I shall not tell you. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>We had six inches of snow up here and it has rained
steadily ever since&mdash;more than a week. And the fog is of<span class="pagenum">27</span>
superior opacity&mdash;quite peerless that way. It is still raining
and fogging. Do you wonder that your unworthy uncle
has come perilously and alarmingly near to loneliness? Yet
I have the companionship, at meals, of one of your excellent
sex, from San Francisco. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Truly, I should like to attend one of your at-homes, but I
fear it must be a long time before I venture down there
again. But when this brumous visitation is past I can <i>look</i>
down, and that assists the imagination to picture you all in
your happy (I hope) home. But if that woolly wolf, Joaquin
Miller, doesn't keep outside the fold I <i>shall</i> come down and
club him soundly. I quite agree with your mother that his
flattery will spoil you. You said I would spoil Phyllis, and
now, you bad girl, you wish to be spoiled yourself. Well, you
can't eat four Millerine oranges.&mdash;My love to all your family. <span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">My dear Partington</span>,</p>

<p>I am very glad indeed to get the good account of Leigh
that you give me. I've feared that he might be rather a bore
to you, but you make me easy on that score. Also I am
pleased that you think he has a sufficient "gift" to do
something in the only direction in which he seems to care
to go.</p>

<p>He is anxious to take the place at the <i>Examiner</i>, and his
uncle thinks that would be best&mdash;if they will give it him.
I'm a little reluctant for many reasons, but there are considerations&mdash;some
of them going to the matter of character
and disposition&mdash;which point to that as the best arrangement.
The boy needs discipline, control, and work.
He needs to learn by experience that life is not all beer and
skittles. Of course you can't quite know him as I do. As to<span class="pagenum">28</span>
his earning anything on the <i>Examiner</i> or elsewhere, that cuts
no figure&mdash;he'll spend everything he can get his fingers on
anyhow; but I feel that he ought to have the advantage
of a struggle for existence where the grass is short and the
soil stony.</p>

<p>Well, I shall let him live down there somehow, and see
what can be done with him. There's a lot of good in him,
and a lot of the other thing, naturally.</p>

<p>I hope Hume has, or will, put you in authority in the
<i>Post</i> and give you a decent salary. He seems quite enthusiastic
about the <i>Post</i> and&mdash;about you.</p>

<p>With sincere regards to Mrs. Partington and all the Partingtonettes,
I am very truly yours, <span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

<p>If you are undertaking to teach my kid (which, unless
it is entirely agreeable to you, you must not do) I hope you
will regard him as a pupil whose tuition is to be paid for like
any other pupil. And you should, I think, name the price.
Will you kindly do so?</p>

<p>Another thing. Leigh tells me you paid him for something
he did for the <i>Wave</i>. That is not right. While you let him
work with you, and under you, his work belongs to you&mdash;is
a part of yours. I mean the work that he does in your
shop for the <i>Wave</i>.</p>

<p>I don't wish to feel that you are bothering with him for
nothing&mdash;will you not tell me your notion of what I should
pay you?</p>

<p>I fancy you'll be on the <i>Examiner</i> pretty soon&mdash;if you wish.</p>

<p>As I was writing to your father I was, of course, strongly
impressed with a sense of <i>you</i>; for you are an intrusive kind
of creature, coming into one's consciousness in the most
lawless way&mdash;Phyllis-like. (Phyllis is my "type and example"
of lawlessness, albeit I'm devoted to her&mdash;a Phyllistine,
as it were.)</p>

<p>Leigh sends me a notice (before the event) of your concert.
I hope it was successful. Was it?</p>

<p>It rains or snows here all the time, and the mountain
struggles in vain to put on its bravery of leaf and flower.
When this kind of thing stops I'm going to put in an application
for you to come up and get your bad impressions of
the place effaced. It is insupportable that my earthly paradise
exist in your memory as a "bad eminence," like Satan's
primacy.</p>

<p>I'm sending you the <i>New England Magazine</i>&mdash;perhaps I
have sent it already&mdash;and a <i>Harper's Weekly</i> with a story
by Mrs. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*, who is a sort of pupil of mine. She used to
do bad work&mdash;does now sometimes; but she will do great
work by-and-by.</p>

<p>I wish you had not got that notion that you cannot learn
to write. You see I'd like you to do <i>some</i> art work that I
can understand and enjoy. I wonder why it is that no note
or combination of notes can be struck out of a piano that
will touch me&mdash;give me an emotion of any kind. It is not
wholly due to my ignorance and bad ear, for other instruments&mdash;the
violin, organ, zither, guitar, etc., sometimes affect
me profoundly. Come, read me the riddle if you know.
What have I done that I should be inaccessible to your
music? I know it is good; I can hear that it is, but not feel
that it is. Therefore to me it is not.</p>

<p>Now that, you will confess, is a woeful state&mdash;"most<span class="pagenum">30</span>
tolerable and not to be endured." Will you not cultivate
some art within the scope of my capacity? Do you think
you could learn to walk on a wire (if it lay on the ground)?
Can you not ride three horses at once if they are suitably
dead? Or swallow swords? Really, you should have some
way to entertain your uncle.</p>

<p>True, you can talk, but you never get the chance; I always
"have the floor." Clearly you must learn to write,
and I mean to get Miller to teach you how to be a poet.</p>

<p>I hope you will write occasionally to me,&mdash;letter-writing
is an art that you do excel in&mdash;as I in "appreciation" of
your excellence in it.</p>

<p>Do you see my boy? I hope he is good, and diligent in his
work.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>You must write to me or I shall withdraw my avuncular
relation to you.</p>

<p>With good will to all your people&mdash;particularly Phyllis&mdash;I
am sincerely your friend, <span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

<p>I think you wrong. On your own principle, laid down in
your letter, that "every man has a right to the full value
of his labor"&mdash;pardon me, good Englishman, I meant
"laboUr"&mdash;you have a right to your wage for the labo<sup><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">&#7799;</span></sup>r
of teaching Leigh. And what work would <i>he</i> get to do but
for you?</p>

<p>I can't hold you and inject shekels into your pocket, but
if the voice of remonstrance has authority to enter at your
ear without a ticket I pray you to show it hospitality.</p>

<p>Leigh doubtless likes to see his work in print, but I hope
you will not let him put anything out until it is as good as
he can make it&mdash;nor then if it is not good <i>enough</i>. And<span class="pagenum">31</span>
that whether he signs it or not. I have talked to him about
the relation of conscience to lab-work, but I don't know

what would touch your compassionate heart.</p>

<p>So you <i>will</i> try to write. That is a good girl. I'm almost
sure you can&mdash;not, of course, all at once, but by-and-by.
And if not, what matter? You are not of the sort, I am sure,

<p>Condole with me&mdash;I have just lost another publisher&mdash;by<span class="pagenum">32</span>
failure. Schulte, of Chicago, publisher of "The Monk"

had a cent from him. I put out three books in a year, and
lo! each one brings down a publisher's gray hair in sorrow
to the grave! for Langton, of "Black Beetles," came to
grief&mdash;that is how Danziger got involved. "O that mine
enemy would <i>publish</i> one of my books!"</p>

<p>I am glad to hear of your success at your concert. If I
could have reached you you should have had the biggest
basket of pretty vegetables that was ever handed over the
footlights. I'm sure you merited it all&mdash;what do you <i>not</i>
merit?</p>

<p>Your father gives me good accounts of my boy. He <i>must</i>
be doing well, I think, by the way he neglects all my commissions.</p>

<p>Enclosed you will find my contribution to the Partington
art gallery, with an autograph letter from the artist. You
can hang them in any light you please and show them to
Richard. He will doubtless be pleased to note how the
latent genius of his boss has burst into bloom.</p>

<p>I accept your sympathy for my misfortunes in publishing.
It serves me right (I don't mean the sympathy does) for
publishing. I should have known that if a publisher cannot
beat an author otherwise, or is too honest to do so, he will<span class="pagenum">33</span>
do it by failing. Once in London a publisher gave me a
check dated two days ahead, and then (the only thing he
could do to make the check worthless)&mdash;ate a pork pie and
died. That was the late John Camden Hotten, to whose
business and virtues my present London publishers, Chatto
and Windus, have succeeded. They have not failed, and they
refuse pork pie, but they deliberately altered the title of
my book.</p>

<p>All this for your encouragement in "learning to write."
Writing books is a noble profession; it has not a shade of
selfishness in it&mdash;nothing worse than conceit.</p>

<p>O yes, you shall have your big basket of flowers if ever I
catch you playing in public. I wish I could give you the
carnations, lilies-of-the-valley, violets, and first-of-the-season

you&mdash;which fact they are trying triumphantly and as hard
as they can to relate in fragrance.</p>

<p>I trust your mother is well of her cold&mdash;that you are all

Thank you for the funny article on the luxury question&mdash;from

discern the expediency of you having any "views" at all

to describe, save by the aid of a wet dishclout for
illustration.</p>

<p>Please ask your father when and where he wants me to
sit for the portrait. If that picture is not sold, and ever
comes into my possession, I shall propose to swap it for
yours. I have always wanted to lay thievish hands on that,

<p>I'm sending you (by way of pretext for writing you) a
magazine that I asked Richard to take to you last evening,<span class="pagenum">35</span>
but which he forgot. There's an illustrated article on gargoyles
and the like, which will interest you. Some of the
creatures are delicious&mdash;more so than I had the sense to
perceive when I saw them alive on Notre Dame.</p>

<p>I want to thank you too for the beautiful muffler before I
take to my willow chair, happy in the prospect of death.
For at this hour, 10:35 p. m., I "have on" a very promising
case of asthma. If I come out of it decently alive in a week
or so I shall go over to your house and see the finished portrait
if it is "still there," like the flag in our national
anthem.</p>

<p>If you are not utterly devoured by mosquitoes perhaps
you'll go to the postoffice and get this. In that hope I write,
not without a strong sense of the existence of the clerks in
the Dead Letter Office at Washington.</p>

<p>I hope you are (despite the mosquitoes) having "heaps"
of rest and happiness. As to me, I have only just recovered
sufficiently to be out, and "improved the occasion" by going
to San Francisco yesterday and returning on the 11:15 boat.
I saw Richard, and he seemed quite solemn at the thought
of the dispersal of his family to the four winds.</p>

<p>I have a joyous letter from Leigh dated "on the road,"
nearing Yosemite. He has been passing through the storied
land of Bret Harte, and is permeated with a sense of its
beauty and romance. When shall you return? May I hope,
then, to see you?</p>

<p>Your kindly note was among a number which I put into
my pocket at the postoffice and forgot until last evening
when I returned from Oakland. (I dared remain up there
only a few hours, and the visit did me no good.)</p>

<p>Of course I should have known that your good heart would
prompt the wish to hear from your patient, but I fear I was
a trifle misanthropic all last week, and indisposed to communicate
with my species.</p>

<p>I came here on Monday of last week, and the change has
done me good. I have no asthma and am slowly getting
back my strength.</p>

<p>Leigh and Ina Peterson passed Sunday with me, and
Leigh recounted his adventures in the mountains. I had
been greatly worried about him; it seems there was abundant
reason. The next time he comes I wish he would
bring you. It is lovely down here. Perhaps you and Katie
can come some time, and I'll drive you all over the valley&mdash;if
you care to drive.</p>

<p>If I continue well I shall remain here or hereabout; if not
I don't know where I shall go. Probably into the Santa
Cruz mountains or to Gilroy. If I could have my way I'd
live at Piedmont.</p>

<p>Do you know I lost Pin the Reptile? I brought him along
in my bicycle bag (I came the latter half of the way bike-back)
and the ungrateful scoundrel wormed himself out and
took to the weeds just before we got to San Jose. So I've
nothing to lavish my second-childhoodish affection upon&mdash;nothing
but just myself.</p>

<p>My permanent address is Oakland, as usual, but <i>you</i> may<span class="pagenum">37</span>
address me here at San Jose if you will be so good as to
address me anywhere. Please do, and tell me of your triumphs
and trials at the Conservatory of Music. I do fervently
hope it may prove a means of prosperity to you, for,
behold, you are The Only Girl in the World Who Merits
Prosperity!</p>

<p>Please give my friendly regards to your people; and so&mdash;Heaven
be good to you.<span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">O, Best of Poets</span>,</p>

<p>How have you the heart to point out what you deem an
imperfection in those lines. Upon my soul, I swear they are
faultless, and "moonlight" is henceforth and forever a
rhyme to "delight." Also, likewise, moreover and furthermore,
a &mdash; is henceforth &mdash;; and &mdash; are forever &mdash;;
and to &mdash; shall be &mdash;; and so forth.
You have established new canons of literary criticism&mdash;more
liberal ones&mdash;and death to the wretch who does not accept
them! Ah, I always knew you were a revolutionist.</p>

<p>Yes, I am in better health, worse luck! For I miss the beef-teaing
expeditions more than you can by trying.</p>

<p>By the way, if you again encounter your fellow practitioner,
Mrs. Hirshberg, please tell her what has become of
her patient, and that I remember her gratefully.</p>

<p>It is not uninteresting to me to hear of your progress in
your art, albeit I am debarred from entrance into the temple
where it is worshiped. After all, art finds its best usefulness
in its reaction upon the character; and in that work I can
trace your proficiency in the art that you love. As you become
a better artist you grow a nicer girl, and if your music
does not cause my tympana to move themselves aright, yet
the niceness is not without its effect upon the soul o' me.<span class="pagenum">38</span>
So I'm not so <i>very</i> inert a clod, after all.</p>

<p>No, Leigh has not infected me with the exploring fad. I
exhausted my capacity in that way years before I had the
advantage of his acquaintance and the contagion of his
example. But I don't like to think of that miserable mountain
sitting there and grinning in the consciousness of having
beaten the Bierce family.</p>

<p>So&mdash;apropos of my brother&mdash;<i>I</i> am "odd" after a certain
fashion! My child, that is blasphemy. You grow hardier
every day of your life, and you'll end as a full colonel yet,
and challenge Man to mortal combat in true Stetsonian
style. Know thy place, thou atom!</p>

<p>Speaking of colonels reminds me that one of the most
eminent of the group had the assurance to write me, asking
for an "audience" to consult about a benefit that she&mdash;<i>she!</i>&mdash;is
getting up for my friend Miss *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*, a glorious
writer and eccentric old maid whom you do not know.
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* evidently wants more notoriety and proposes to shine
by Miss *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* light. I was compelled to lower the temperature
of the situation with a letter curtly courteous. Not
even to assist Miss *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* shall my name be mixed up with
those of that gang. But of course all that does not amuse
you.</p>

<p>I wish I could have a chat with you. I speak to nobody
but my chambermaid and the waiter at my restaurant. By
the time I see you I shall have lost the art of speech altogether
and shall communicate with you by the sign language.</p>

<p>God be good to you and move you to write to me sometimes.</p>

<p>You may, I think, expect my assistance in choosing between
(or among) your suitors next month, early. I propose
to try living in Oakland again for a short time beginning
about then. But I shall have much to do the first few days&mdash;possibly
in settling my earthly affairs for it is my determination
to be hanged for killing all those suitors. That seems
to me the simplest way of disembarrassing you. As to me&mdash;it
is the "line of least resistance"&mdash;unless they fight.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>So you have been ill. You must not be ill, my child&mdash;it
disturbs my Marcus Aurelian tranquillity, and is most selfishly

<p>Mourn with me: the golden leaves of my poplars are now

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Dear Sterling</span>,</p>

<p>This is just a hasty note to acknowledge receipt of your
letter and the poems. I hope to reach those pretty soon and
give them the attention which I am sure they will prove to
merit&mdash;which I cannot do now. By the way, I wonder why
most of you youngsters so persistently tackle the sonnet.
For the same reason, I suppose, that a fellow always wants
to make his first appearance on the stage in the rôle of
"Hamlet." It is just the holy cheek of you.</p>

<p>Yes, Leigh prospers fairly well, and I&mdash;well, I don't know
if it is prosperity; it is a pretty good time.</p>

<p>I suppose I shall have to write to that old scoundrel
Grizzly,<a name="fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to give him my new address, though I supposed
he had it; and the old one would do, anyhow. Now that his
cub has returned he probably doesn't care for the other
plantigrades of his kind.</p>

<p>Thank you for telling me so much about some of our companions
and companionesses of the long ago. I fear that not
all my heart was in my baggage when I came over here.
There's a bit of it, for example, out there by that little lake
in the hills.</p>

<p>So I may have a photograph of one of your pretty sisters.
Why, of course I want it&mdash;I want the entire five of them;
their pictures, I mean. If you had been a nice fellow you
would have let me know them long ago. And how about<span class="pagenum">41</span>
that other pretty girl, your infinitely better half? You
might sneak into the envelope a little portrait of <i>her</i>, lest I
forget, lest I forget. But I've not yet forgotten.</p>

<p>The new century's best blessings to the both o' you. <span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;In your studies of poetry have you dipped into
Stedman's new "American Anthology"? It is the most notable
collection of American verse that has been made&mdash;on
the whole, a book worth having. In saying so I rather pride
myself on my magnanimity; for of course I don't think he
has done as well by me as he might have done. That, I
suppose, is what every one thinks who happens to be alive
to think it. So I try to be in the fashion. <span class="flright">A. B.</span></p>

<p>I've been a long while getting to your verses, but there

pretty good verses, with here and there <i>very</i> good lines. I'd
a strong temptation to steal one or two for my "Passing
Show," but I knew what an avalanche of verses it would
bring down upon me from other poets&mdash;as every mention
of a new book loads my mail with new books for a month.</p>

<p>If I ventured to advise you I should recommend to you
the simple, ordinary meters and forms native to our language.</p>

I've forgotten.</p>

<p>Your letter of the 16th has just come and as I am waiting
at my office (where I seldom go) I shall amuse myself by
replying "to onct." See here, I don't purpose that your
attack on poor Morrow's book shall become a "continuous
performance," nor even an "annual ceremony." It is not
"rot." It is not "filthy." It does not "suggest bed-pans,"&mdash;at
least it did not to me, and I'll wager something that
Morrow never thought of them. Observe and consider: If
his hero and heroine had been man and wife, the bed-pan
would have been there, just the same; yet you would not
have thought of it. Every reader would have been touched
by the husband's devotion. A physician has to do with
many unpleasant things; whom do his ministrations disgust?
A trained nurse lives in an atmosphere of bed-pans&mdash;to
whom is her presence or work suggestive of them? I'm
thinking of the heroic Father Damien and his lepers; do
you dwell upon the rotting limbs and foul distortions of his
unhappy charges? Is not his voluntary martyrdom one of
the sanest, cleanest, most elevating memories in all history?
Then it is <i>not</i> the bed-pan necessity that disgusts
you; it is something else. It is the fact that the hero of the
story, being neither physician, articled nurse, nor certificated
husband, nevertheless performed <i>their</i> work. He ministered
to the helpless in a natural way without authority
from church or college, quite irregular and improper and
all that. My noble critic, there speaks in your blood the
Untamed Philistine. You were not caught young enough.
You came into letters and art with all your beastly conventionalities
in full mastery of you. Take a purge. Forget
that there are Philistines. Forget that they have put their
abominable pantalettes upon the legs of Nature. Forget
that their code of morality and manners (it stinks worse<span class="pagenum">43</span>
than a bed-pan) does <i>not</i> exist in the serene altitude of great
art, toward which you have set your toes and into which I
want you to climb. I know about this thing. I, too, tried to
rise with all that dead weight dragging at my feet. Well, I
could not&mdash;now I could if I cared to. In my mind I do. It
is not freedom of act&mdash;not freedom of living, for which I
contend, but freedom of thought, of mind, of spirit; the
freedom to see in the horrible laws, prejudices, custom,
conventionalities of the multitude, something good for
them, but of no value to you <i>in your art.</i> In your life and
conduct defer to as much of it as you will (you'll find it convenient
to defer to a whole lot), but in your mind and art
let not the Philistine enter, nor even speak a word through
the keyhole. My own chief objection to Morrow's story is
(as I apprised him) its unnaturalness. He did not dare to
follow the logical course of his narrative. He was too cowardly
(or had too keen an eye upon his market of prudes)
to make hero and heroine join in the holy bonds of <i>bed</i>lock,
as they naturally, inevitably and rightly would have done
long before she was able to be about. I daresay that, too,
would have seemed to you "filthy," without the parson
and his fee. When you analyze your objection to the story
(as I have tried to do for you) you will find that it all crystallizes
into that&mdash;the absence of the parson. I don't envy
you your view of the matter, and I really don't think you
greatly enjoy it yourself. I forgot to say: Suppose they had
been two men, two partners in hunting, mining, or exploring,
as frequently occurs. Would the bed-pan suggestion
have come to you? Did it come to you when you read of the
slow, but not uniform, starvation of Greeley's party in the
arctic? Of course not. Then it is a matter, not of bed-pans,
but of sex-exposure (unauthorized by the church), of prudery&mdash;of<span class="pagenum">44</span>
that artificial thing, the "sense of shame," of
which the great Greeks knew nothing; of which the great
Japanese know nothing; of which Art knows nothing. Dear
Doctor, do you really put trousers on your piano-legs?
Does your indecent intimacy with your mirror make you
blush?</p>

<p>There, there's the person whom I've been waiting for
(I'm to take her to dinner, and I'm not married to even so
much of her as her little toe) has come; and until you offend
again, you are immune from the switch. May all your
brother Philistines have to "Kiss the place to make it
well."</p>

<p>I send back the poems, with a few suggestions. You grow
great so rapidly that I shall not much longer dare to touch
your work. I mean that.</p>

<p>Your criticisms of Stedman's Anthology are just. But
equally just ones can be made of any anthology. None of
them can suit any one. I fancy Stedman did not try to
"live up" to his standard, but to make <i>representative</i>,
though not always the <i>best</i>, selections. It would hardly do
to leave out Whitman, for example. <i>We</i> may not like him;
thank God, we don't; but many others&mdash;the big fellows
too&mdash;do; and in England he is thought great. And then
Stedman has the bad luck to know a lot of poets personally&mdash;many
bad poets. Put yourself in his place. Would
you leave out me if you honestly thought my work bad?</p>

<p>In any compilation we will all miss some of our favorites&mdash;and<span class="pagenum">45</span>
find some of the public's favorites. You miss
from Whittier "Joseph Sturge"&mdash;I the sonnet "Forgiveness,"
and so forth. Alas, there is no universal standard!</p>

<p>Thank you for the photographs. Miss *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* is a pretty
girl, truly, and has the posing instinct as well. She has the
place of honor on my mantel. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* But what scurvy knave
has put the stage-crime into her mind? If you know that
life as I do you will prefer that she die, poor girl.</p>

<p>It is no trouble, but a pleasure, to go over your verses&mdash;I
am as proud of your talent as if I'd made it.</p>

I am not even personally acquainted with the editor of the

<p>I enclose a proof of the poem<a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;all marked up. The poem
was offered to the Journal, but to the wrong editor. I would
not offer it to him in whose department it could be used,
for he once turned down some admirable verses of my
friend Scheffauer which I sent him. I'm glad the Journal is
<i>not</i> to have it, for it now goes into the Washington Post&mdash;and
the Post into the best houses here and elsewhere&mdash;a
good, clean, unyellow paper. I'll send you some copies with
the poem.</p>

<p>I think my marks are intelligible&mdash;I mean my <i>re</i>marks.
Perhaps you'll not approve all, or anything, that I did to
the poem; I'll only ask you to endure. When you publish in
covers you can restore to the original draft if you like. I had
not time (after my return from New York) to get your
approval and did the best and the least I could.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>My love to your pretty wife and sister. Let me know how
hard you hate me for monkeying with your sacred lines.</p>

<p class="left65">Sincerely yours, <span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

<p class="p2">Yes, your poem recalled my "Invocation" as I read it;
but it is better, and not too much like&mdash;hardly like at all
except in the "political" part. Both, in that, are characterized,
I think, by decent restraint. How *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* would, at
those places, have ranted and chewed soap!&mdash;a superior
quality of soap, I confess. <span class="flright">A. B.</span></p>

<p>I am glad my few words of commendation were not unpleasing
to you. I meant them all and more. You ought to
have praise, seeing that it is all you got. The "Post," like<span class="pagenum">48</span>
most other newspapers, "don't pay for poetry." What a
damning confession! It means that the public is as insensible
to poetry as a pig to&mdash;well, to poetry. To any sane
mind such a poem as yours is worth more than all the other
contents of a newspaper for a year.</p>

<p>I've not found time to consider your "bit of blank" yet&mdash;at
least not as carefully as it probably merits.</p>

<p>My relations with the present editor of the Examiner are
not unfriendly, I hope, but they are too slight to justify
me in suggesting anything to him, or even drawing his
attention to anything. I hoped you would be sufficiently
"enterprising" to get your poem into the paper if you cared
to have it there. I wrote Dr. Doyle about you. He is a dear
fellow and you should know each other. As to Scheffauer,
he is another. If you want him to see your poem why not
send it to him? But the last I heard he was very ill. I'm
rather anxious to hear more about him.</p>

<p>It was natural to enclose the stamps, but I won't have
it so&mdash;so there! as the women say.</p>

<p>Here is the bit of blank. When are we to see the book?
Needless question&mdash;when you can spare the money to pay
for publication, I suppose, if by that time you are ambitious
to achieve public inattention. That's my notion of
encouragement&mdash;I like to cheer up the young author as he
sets his face toward "the peaks of song."</p>

<p>Say, that photograph of the pretty sister&mdash;the one with a
downward slope of the eyes&mdash;is all faded out. That is a
real misfortune: it reduces the sum of human happiness<span class="pagenum">49</span>
hereabout. Can't you have one done in fast colors and let

that I like the better for my wall. Sincerely yours, <span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

<p>I enclose the poems with a few suggestions. They require
little criticism of the sort that would be "helpful." As to
their merit I think them good, but not great. I suppose you
do not expect to write great things every time. Yet in the
body of your letter (of Oct. 22) you do write greatly&mdash;and
say that the work is "egoistic" and "unprintable." If it<a name="fnanchor_4" id="fnanchor_4"></a><a href="#footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
were addressed to another person than myself I should say
that it is "printable" exceedingly. Call it what you will,
but let me tell you it will probably be long before you write
anything better than some&mdash;many&mdash;of these stanzas.</p>

<p>You ask if you have correctly answered your own questions.
Yes; in four lines of your running comment:</p>

<p>"I suppose that I'd do the greater good in the long run by
making my work as good poetry as possible."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Of course I deplore your tendency to dalliance with the
demagogic muse. I hope you will not set your feet in the
dirty paths&mdash;leading nowhither&mdash;of social and political
"reform".... I hope you will not follow *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* in making
a sale of your poet's birthright for a mess of "popularity."
If you do I shall have to part company with you, as I have
done with him and at least <i>one</i> of his betters, for I draw the
line at demagogues and anarchists, however gifted and however
beloved.</p>

<p>Let the "poor" alone&mdash;they are oppressed by nobody but<span class="pagenum">50</span>
God. Nobody hates them, nobody despises. "The rich" love
them a deal better than they love one another. But I'll not
go into these matters; your own good sense must be your
salvation if you are saved. I recognise the temptations of
environment: you are of San Francisco, the paradise of ignorance,
anarchy and general yellowness. Still, a poet is not
altogether the creature of his place and time&mdash;at least not
of his to-day and his parish.</p>

<p>By the way, you say that *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* is your only associate
that knows anything of literature. She is a dear girl, but
look out for her; she will make you an anarchist if she can,
and persuade you to kill a President or two every fine
morning. I warrant you she can pronounce the name of
McKinley's assassin to the ultimate zed, and has a little
graven image of him next her heart.</p>

<p>Yes, you can republish the Memorial Day poem without
the <i>Post's</i> consent&mdash;could do so in "book form" even if the
<i>Post</i> had copyrighted it, which it did not do. I think the
courts have held that in purchasing work for publication in
his newspaper or magazine the editor acquires no right in
it, <i>except for that purpose</i>. Even if he copyright it that is
only to protect him from other newspapers or magazines;
the right to publish in a book remains with the author.
Better ask a lawyer though&mdash;preferably without letting
him know whether you are an editor or an author.</p>

<p>I ought to have answered (as well as able) these questions
before, but I have been ill and worried, and have written
few letters, and even done little work, and that only of the
pot-boiling sort.</p>

<p>My daughter has recovered and returned to Los Angeles.</p>

<p>Please thank Miss *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* for the beautiful photographs&mdash;I
mean for being so beautiful as to "take" them, for doubtless<span class="pagenum">51</span>
I owe their possession to you.</p>

<p>I wrote Doyle about you and he cordially praised your
work as incomparably superior to his own and asked that
you visit him. He's a lovable fellow and you'd not regret
going to Santa Cruz and boozing with him.</p>

<p>Thank you for the picture of Grizzly and the cub of him.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">My dear Sterling</span>,</p>

<p>Where are you going to stop?&mdash;I mean at what stage of
development? I presume you have not a "whole lot" of
poems really writ, and have not been feeding them to me,
the least good first, and not in the order of their production.
So it must be that you are advancing at a stupendous
rate. This last<a name="fnanchor_5" id="fnanchor_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> beats any and all that went before&mdash;or I
am bewitched and befuddled. I dare not trust myself to say
what I think of it. In manner it is great, but the greatness
of the theme!&mdash;that is beyond anything.</p>

<p>It is a new field, the broadest yet discovered. To paraphrase
Coleridge,</p>

<p class="poem">You are the first that ever burst<br />
Into that silent [unknown] sea&mdash;</p>

<p>a silent sea <i>because</i> no one else has burst into it in full song.
True, there have been short incursions across the "border,"
but only by way of episode. The tremendous phenomena of
Astronomy have never had adequate poetic treatment,
their meaning adequate expression. You must make it your
own domain. You shall be the poet of the skies, the prophet<span class="pagenum">52</span>
of the suns. Don't fiddle-faddle with such infinitesimal and
tiresome trivialities as (for example) the immemorial squabbles
of "rich" and "poor" on this "mote in the sun-beam."
(Both "classes," when you come to that, are about equally
disgusting and unworthy&mdash;there's not a pin's moral difference
between them.) Let them cheat and pick pockets and
cut throats to the satisfaction of their base instincts, but do
thou regard them not. Moreover, by that great law of change
which you so clearly discern, there can be no permanent
composition of their nasty strife. "Settle" it how they will&mdash;another
beat of the pendulum and all is as before; and ere
another, Man will again be savage, sitting on his naked
haunches and gnawing raw bones.</p>

<p>Yes, circumstances make the "rich" what they are. And
circumstances make the poor what <i>they</i> are. I have known
both, long and well. The rich&mdash;<i>while</i> rich&mdash;are a trifle
better. There's nothing like poverty to nurture badness.
But in this country there are no such "classes" as "rich"
and "poor": as a rule, the wealthy man of to-day was a
poor devil yesterday; the poor devils of to-day have an
equal chance to be rich to-morrow&mdash;or would have if they
had equal brains and providence. The system that gives
them the chance is not an oppressive one. Under a really
oppressive system a salesman in a village grocery could not
have risen to a salary of one million dollars a year because
he was worth it to his employers, as Schwab has done.
True, some men get rich by dishonesty, but the poor commonly
cheat as hard as they can and remain poor&mdash;thereby
escaping observation and censure. The moral difference between
cheating to the limit of a small opportunity and
cheating to the limit of a great one is to me indiscernable.
The workman who "skimps his work" is just as much a<span class="pagenum">53</span>
rascal as the "director" who corners a crop.</p>

<p>As to "Socialism." I am something of a Socialist myself;
that is, I think that the principle, which has always coexisted
with competition, each safeguarding the other, may
be advantageously extended. But those who rail against
"the competitive system," and think they suffer from it,
really suffer from their own unthrift and incapacity. For
the competent and provident it is an ideally perfect system.
As the other fellows are not of those who effect permanent
reforms, or reforms of any kind, pure Socialism is the dream
of a dream.</p>

<p>But why do I write all this. One's opinions on such matters
are unaffected by reason and instance; they are born of
feeling and temperament. There is a Socialist diathesis, as
there is an Anarchist diathesis. Could you teach a bulldog
to retrieve, or a sheep to fetch and carry? Could you make
a "born artist" comprehend a syllogism? As easily persuade
a poet that black is not whatever color he loves. Somebody
has defined poetry as "glorious nonsense." It is not an altogether
false definition, albeit I consider poetry the flower
and fruit of speech and would rather write gloriously than
sensibly. But if poets saw things as they are they would
write no more poetry.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I venture to ask you: <i>Can't</i> you see in the
prosperity of the strong and the adversity of the weak a
part of that great beneficent law, "the survival of the
fittest"? Don't you see that such evils as inhere in "the
competitive system" are evils only to individuals, but
blessings to the race by gradually weeding out the incompetent
and their progeny?</p>

<p>I've done, i' faith. Be any kind of 'ist or 'er that you will,
but don't let it get into your ink. Nobody is calling you to<span class="pagenum">54</span>
deliver your land from Error's chain. What we want of you
is poetry, not politics. And if you care for fame just have
the goodness to consider if any "champion of the poor"
has ever obtained it. From the earliest days down to Massanielo,
Jack Cade and Eugene Debs the leaders and
prophets of "the masses" have been held unworthy. And
with reason too, however much injustice is mixed in with
the right of it. Eventually the most conscientious, popular
and successful "demagogue" comes into a heritage of infamy.
The most brilliant gifts cannot save him. That will
be the fate of Edwin Markham if he does not come out o'
that, and it will be the fate of George Sterling if he will not
be warned.</p>

<p>You think that "the main product of that system" (the
"competitive") "is the love of money." What a case of the
cart before the horse! The love of money is not the product,
but the root, of the system&mdash;not the effect, but the cause.
When one man desires to be better off than another he
competes with him. You can abolish the system when you
can abolish the desire&mdash;when you can make man as Nature
did <i>not</i> make him, content to be as poor as the poorest. Do
away with the desire to excel and you may set up your
Socialism at once. But what kind of a race of sloths and
slugs will you have?</p>

<p>But, bless me, I shall <i>never</i> have done if I say all that
comes to me.</p>

<p>Why, of course my remarks about *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* were facetious&mdash;playful.
She really is an anarchist, and her sympathies are
with criminals, whom she considers the "product" of the
laws, but&mdash;well, she inherited the diathesis and can no
more help it than she can the color of her pretty eyes. But
she is a child&mdash;and except in so far as her convictions make<span class="pagenum">55</span>
her impossible they do not count. She would not hurt a
fly&mdash;not even if, like the toad, it had a precious jewel in its
head that it did not work for. But I am speaking of the
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* that <i>I</i> knew. If I did not know that the anarchist
leopard's spots "will wash," your words would make me
think that she might have changed. It does not matter
what women think, if thinking it may be called, and *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
will never be other than lovable.</p>

<p>Lest you have <i>not</i> a copy of the verses addressed to me I
enclose one that I made myself. Of course their publication
could not be otherwise than pleasing to me if you care to do
it. You need not fear the "splendid weight" expression,
and so forth&mdash;there is nothing "conceited" in the poem.
As it was addressed to me, I have not criticised it&mdash;I <i>can't</i>.
And I guess it needs no criticism.</p>

<p>I fear for the other two-thirds of this latest poem. If you
descend from Arcturus to Earth, from your nebulae to your
neighbors, from Life to lives, from the measureless immensities
of space to the petty passions of us poor insects, won't
you incur the peril of anti-climax? I doubt if you can touch
the "human interest" after those high themes without an
awful tumble. I should be sorry to see the poem "peter
out," or "soak in." It would be as if Goethe had let his
"Prologue in Heaven" expire in a coon song. You have
reached the "heights of dream" all right, but how are you
to stay there to the end? By the way, you must perfect
yourself in Astronomy, or rather get a general knowledge of
it, which I fear you lack. Be sure about the pronunciation
of astronomical names.</p>

<p>I have read some of Jack London's work and think it
clever. Of Whitaker I never before heard, I fear. If London
wants to criticise your "Star poem" what's the objection?<span class="pagenum">56</span>
I should not think, though, from his eulogism of *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*, that
he is very critical. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Where are you to place Browning? Among thinkers. In
his younger days, when he wrote in English, he stood among
the poets. I remember writing once&mdash;of the thinker: "There's
nothing more obscure than Browning except blacking." I'll
stand to that.</p>

<p>No, don't take the trouble to send me a copy of these
verses: I expect to see them in a book pretty soon. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Dear Sterling</span>,</p>

<p>I am glad to know that you too have a good opinion of
that poem.<a name="fnanchor_6" id="fnanchor_6"></a><a href="#footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> One should know about one's own work. Most
writers think their work good, but good writers know it.
Pardon me if I underrated your astronomical knowledge.
My belief was based on your use of those names. I never
met with the spelling "Betelgeux"; and even if it is correct
and picturesque I'd not use it if I were you, for it does not
quite speak itself, and you can't afford to jolt the reader's
attention from your thought to a matter of pronunciation.
In my student days we, I am sure, were taught to say
Procy&#180;on. I don't think I've heard it pronounced since, and
I've no authority at hand. If you are satisfied with Pro&#180;cyon
I suppose it is that. But your pronunciation was Aldeb&#180;aran
or your meter very crazy indeed. I asked (with an interrogation
point) if it were not Aldeba&#180;ran&mdash;and I think it is.
Fomalhaut I don't know about; I thought it French and
masculine. In that case it would, I suppose, be "ho," not
"hote."</p>

<p>Don't cut out that stanza, even if "clime" doesn't seem<span class="pagenum">57</span>
to me to have anything to do with duration. The stanza is
good enough to stand a blemish.</p>

<p>"Ye stand rebuked by suns who claim"&mdash;I was wrong in
substituting "that" for "who," not observing that it would
make it ambiguous. I merely yielded to a favorite impulse:
to say "that" instead of "who," and did not count the
cost.</p>

<p>Don't cut out <i>any</i> stanza&mdash;if you can't perfect them let
them go imperfect.</p>

<p>"Without or genesis or end."<br />
"Devoid of birth, devoid of end."</p>

<p>These are not so good as</p>

<p>"Without beginning, without end";&mdash;I submit them to
suggest a way to overcome that identical rhyme. All you
have to do is get rid of the second "without." I should not
like "impend."</p>

<p>Yes, I vote for Orion's <i>sword</i> of suns. "Cimetar" sounds
better, but it is more specific&mdash;less generic. It is modern&mdash;or,
rather, less ancient than "sword," and makes one think
of Turkey and the Holy Land. But "sword"&mdash;there were
swords before Homer. And I don't think the man who
named this constellation ever saw a curved blade. And yet,
and yet&mdash;"cimetar of suns" is "mighty catchin'."</p>

<p>No, indeed, I could not object to your considering the
heavens in a state of war. I have sometimes fancied I could
hear the rush and roar of it. Why, a few months ago I began
a sonnet thus:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span class="o1">"Not as two erring spheres together grind,</span><br />
With monstrous ruin, in the vast of space,<br />
Destruction born of that malign embrace&mdash;<br />
Their hapless peoples all to death consigned&mdash;" etc.</p>

<p>I've been a star-gazer all my life&mdash;from my habit of being<span class="pagenum">58</span>
"out late," I guess; and the things have always seemed to
me <i>alive</i>.</p>

<p>The change in the verses <i>ad meum</i>, from "<i>thy</i> clearer
light" to "<i>the</i> clearer light" may have been made modestly
or inadvertently&mdash;I don't recollect. It is, of course, no
improvement and you may do as you please. I'm uniformly
inadvertent, but intermittently modest.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>A class of stuff that I can't (without "trouble in the office")
write my own way I will not write at all. So I'm writing
very little of anything but nonsense. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>All right&mdash;I only wanted you to be <i>sure</i> about those
names of stars; it would never do to be less than sure.</p>

<p>After all our talk (made by me) I guess that stanza would
better stand as first written. "Clime"&mdash;climate&mdash;connotes
temperature, weather, and so forth, in ordinary speech, but
a poet may make his own definitions, I suppose, and compel
the reader to study them out and accept them.</p>

<p>Your misgiving regarding your inability to reach so high
a plane again as in this poem is amusing, but has an element
of the pathetic. It certainly is a misfortune for a
writer to do his <i>best</i> work early; but I fancy you'd better
trust your genius and do its bidding whenever the monkey
chooses to bite. "The Lord will provide." Of course you
have read Stockton's story "His Wife's Deceased Sister."<span class="pagenum">59</span>
But Stockton gets on very well, despite "The Lady or the
Tiger." I've a notion that you'll find other tragedies among
the stars if earth doesn't supply you with high enough
themes.</p>

<p>Will I write a preface for the book? Why, yes, if you think
me competent. Emerson commands us to "hitch our wagon
to a star?" and, egad! here's a whole constellation&mdash;a universe&mdash;of
stars to draw mine! It makes me blink to think
of it.</p>

<p>Of course your star poem has one defect&mdash;if it is a defect&mdash;that
limits the circle of understanding and admiring
readers&mdash;its lack of "<i>human</i> interest." We human
insects, as a rule, care for nothing but ourselves, and think
that is best which most closely touches such emotions and
sentiments as grow out of our relations, the one with
another. I don't share the preference, and a few others do
not, believing that there are things more interesting than
men and women. The Heavens, for example. But who
knows, or cares anything about them&mdash;even knows the
name of a single constellation? Hardly any one but the<span class="pagenum">60</span>
professional astronomers&mdash;and there are not enough of
them to buy your books and give you fame. I should be
sorry not to have that poem published&mdash;sorry if you did
not write more of the kind. But while it may impress and
dazzle "the many" it will not win them. They want you to
finger their heart-strings and pull the cord that works their
arms and legs. So you must finger and pull&mdash;too.</p>

<p>The Château Yquem came all right, and is good. Thank
you for it&mdash;albeit I'm sorry you feel that you must do
things like that. It is very conventional and, I fear,
"proper." However, I remember that you used to do so
when you could not by any stretch of imagination have felt
that you were under an "obligation." So I guess it is all
right&mdash;just your way of reminding me of the old days.
Anyhow, the wine is so much better than my own that I've
never a scruple when drinking it.</p>

<p>Has "Maid Marian" a photograph of me?&mdash;I don't
remember. If not I'll send her one; I've just had some
printed from a negative five or six years old. I've renounced
the photograph habit, as one renounces other habits when
age has made them ridiculous&mdash;or impossible.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Dear Sterling</span>,</p>

<p>I fancy you must fear by this time that I did not get the
poems, but I did. I'll get at them, doubtless, after awhile,
though a good deal of manuscript&mdash;including a couple of
novels!&mdash;is ahead of them; and one published book of bad
poems awaits a particular condemnation.</p>

<p>I'm a little embarrassed about the preface which I'm to
write. I fear you must forego the preface or I the dedication.
That kind of "coöperation" doesn't seem in very good<span class="pagenum">62</span>
taste: it smacks of "mutual admiration" in the bad sense,
and the reviewers would probably call it "log-rolling." Of
course it doesn't matter too much what the reviewers say,
but it matters a lot what the intelligent readers think; and
your book will have no others. I really shouldn't like to
write the preface of a book dedicated to me, though I did
not think of that at first.</p>

<p>The difficulty could be easily removed by <i>not</i> dedicating
the book to me were it not that that would sacrifice the
noble poem with my name atop of it. That poem is itself
sufficiently dedicatory if printed by itself in the forepages
of the book and labeled "Dedication&mdash;To Ambrose
Bierce." I'm sure that vanity has nothing to do, or little
to do, with my good opinion of the verses. And, after all,
they <i>show</i> that I have said <i>to you</i> all that I could say to the
reader in your praise and encouragement. What do you
think?</p>

<p>As to dedicating individual poems to other fellows, I have
not the slightest hesitancy in advising you against it. The
practice smacks of the amateur and is never, I think, pleasing
to anybody but the person so honored. The custom has
fallen into "innocuous desuetude" and there appears to be
no call for its revival. Pay off your obligations (if such there
be) otherwise. You may put it this way if you like: The
whole book being dedicated to me, no part of it <i>can</i> be
dedicated to another. Or this way: Secure in my exalted
position I don't purpose sharing the throne with rival (and
inferior) claimants. They be gam doodled!</p>

<p>Seriously&mdash;but I guess it is serious enough as it stands.
It occurs to me that in saying: "no part of it <i>can</i> be dedicated
to another" I might be understood as meaning: "no
part of it <i>must</i> be," etc. No; I mean only that the dedication<span class="pagenum">63</span>
to another would contradict the dedication to me. The
two things are (as a matter of fact) incompatible.</p>

<p>Well, if you think a short preface by me preferable to the
verses with my name, all right; I will cheerfully write it,
and that will leave you free to honor your other friends if
you care to. But those are great lines, and implying, as they
do, all that a set preface could say, it seems to me that they
ought to stand.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">My dear Sterling</span>,</p>

<p>You are a brick. You shall do as you will. My chief reluctance
is that if it become known, or <i>when</i> it becomes known,
there may ensue a suspicion of my honesty in praising you
and <i>your</i> book; for critics and readers are not likely to look
into the matter of dates. For your sake I should be sorry to
have it thought that my commendation was only a log-rolling
incident; for myself, I should care nothing about it.
This eel is accustomed to skinning.</p>

<p>It is not the least pleasing of my reflections that my
friends have always liked my work&mdash;or me&mdash;well enough
to want to publish my books at their own expense. Everything
that I have written could go to the public that way
if I would consent. In the two instances in which I did consent
they got their money back all right, and I do not doubt
that it will be so in this; for if I did not think there was at
least a little profit in a book of mine I should not offer it to
a publisher. "Shapes of Clay" <i>ought</i> to be published in
California, and it would have been long ago if I had not<span class="pagenum">64</span>
been so lazy and so indisposed to dicker with the publishers.
Properly advertised&mdash;which no book of mine ever has
been&mdash;it should sell there if nowhere else. Why, then, do
<i>I</i> not put up the money? Well, for one reason, I've none to
put up. Do you care for the other reasons?</p>

<p>But I must make this a condition. If there is a loss, <i>I</i> am
to bear it. To that end I shall expect an exact accounting
from your Mr. Wood, and the percentage that Scheff. purposes
having him pay to me is to go to you. The copyright
is to be mine, but nothing else until you are entirely recouped.
But all this I will arrange with Scheff., who, I take
it, is to attend to the business end of the matter, with, of
course, your assent to the arrangements that he makes.</p>

<p>I shall write Scheff. to-day to go ahead and make his contract
with Mr. Wood on these lines. Scheff. appears not to
know who the "angel" in the case is, and he need not,
unless, or until, you want him to.</p>

<p>I've a pretty letter from Maid Marian in acknowledgment
of the photograph. I shall send one to Mrs. Sterling
at once, in the sure and certain hope of getting another. It
is good of her to remember my existence, considering that
your scoundrelly monopoly of her permitted us to meet so
seldom. I go in for a heavy tax on married men who live
with their wives.</p>

<p>"She holds no truce with Death <i>or</i> Peace" means that
with <i>one</i> of them she holds no truce; "nor" makes it mean
that she holds no truce with <i>either</i>. The misuse of "or" (its
use to mean "nor") is nearly everybody's upsetting sin. So
common is it that "nor" instead usually sounds harsh.</p>

<p>I omitted the verses on "Puck," not because Bunner is
dead, but because his work is dead too, and the verses
appear to lack intrinsic merit to stand alone. I shall perhaps<span class="pagenum">65</span>
omit a few more when I get the proofs (I wish you
could see the bushels I've left out already) and add a few
serious ones.</p>

<p>I'm glad no end that you and Scheff. have met. I'm fond
of the boy and he likes me, I think. He too has a book of
verses on the ways, and I hope for it a successful launching.
I've been through it all; some of it is great in the matter of
thews and brawn; some fine.</p>

<p>Pardon the typewriter; I wanted a copy of this letter.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Dear Sterling</span>,</p>

<p>It is good to hear from you again and to know that the
book is so nearly complete as to be in the hands of the publishers.
I dare say they will not have it, and you'll have to
get it out at your own expense. When it comes to that I
shall hope to be of service to you, as you have been to me.</p>

<p>So you like Scheff. Yes, he is a good boy and a good friend.
I wish you had met our friend Dr. Doyle, who has now
gone the long, lone journey. It has made a difference to me,
but that matters little, for the time is short in which to
grieve. I shall soon be going his way.</p>

<p>No, I shall not put anything about the *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* person into
"Shapes of Clay." His offence demands another kind of
punishment, and until I meet him he goes unpunished. I
once went to San Francisco to punish him (but that was in
hot blood) but *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* of "The Wave" told me the man was
a hopeless invalid, suffering from locomotor ataxia. I have
always believed that until I got your letter and one from
Scheff. Is it not so?&mdash;or <i>was</i> it not? If not he has good
reason to think me a coward, for his offence was what men<span class="pagenum">66</span>
are killed for; but of course one does not kill a helpless person,
no matter what the offence is. If *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* lied to me I am
most anxious to know it; he has always professed himself a
devoted friend.</p>

<p>The passage that you quote from Jack London strikes me
as good. I don't dislike the word "penetrate"&mdash;rather like
it. It is in frequent use regarding exploration and discovery.
But I think you right about "rippling"; it is too lively
a word to be outfitted with such an adjective as "melancholy."
I see London has an excellent article in "The
Critic" on "The Terrible and Tragic in Fiction." He knows
how to think a bit.</p>

<p>What do I think of Cowley-Brown and his "Goosequill"?
I did not know that he had revived it; it died several years
ago. I never met him, but in both Chicago and London
(where he had "The Philistine," or "The Anti-Philistine,"
I do not at the moment remember which) he was most kind
to me and my work. In one number of his magazine&mdash;the
London one&mdash;he had four of my stories and a long article
about me which called the blushes to my maiden cheek like
the reflection of a red rose in the petal of a violet. Naturally
I think well of Cowley-Brown.</p>

<p>You make me sad to think of the long leagues and the
monstrous convexity of the earth separating me from your
camp in the redwoods. There are few things that I would
rather do than join that party; and I'd be the last to strike
my tent and sling my swag. Alas, it cannot be&mdash;not this
year. My outings are limited to short runs along this coast.
I was about to set out on one this morning; and wrote a
hasty note to Scheff in consequence of my preparations. In
five hours I was suffering from asthma, and am now confined
to my room. But for eight months of the year here I<span class="pagenum">67</span>
am immune&mdash;as I never was out there.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>You will have to prepare yourself to endure a good deal of
praise when that book is out. One does not mind when one
gets accustomed to it. It neither pleases nor bores; you
will have just no feeling about it at all. But if you really
care for <i>my</i> praise I hope you have quoted a bit of it at the
head of those dedicatory verses, as I suggested. That will
give them a <i>raison d'être</i>.</p>

<p>With best regards to Mrs. Sterling and Katie I am sincerely
yours, <span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Dear Scheff</span>:</p>

<p>I got the proofs yesterday, and am returning them by this
mail. The "report of progress" is every way satisfactory,
and I don't doubt that a neat job is being done.</p>

<p>The correction that you made is approved. I should have
wanted and expected you to make many corrections and
suggestions, but that I have had a purpose in making this
book&mdash;namely, that it should represent my work at its average.
In pursuance of this notion I was not hospitable even
to suggestions, and have retained much work that I did not
myself particularly approve; some of it trivial. You know
I have always been addicted to trifling, and no book from
which trivialities were excluded would fairly represent me.</p>

<p>I could not commend this notion in another. In your work
and Sterling's I have striven hard to help you to come as
near to perfection as we could, because perfection is what
you and he want, and as young writers ought to want, the<span class="pagenum">68</span>
character of your work being higher than mine. I reached
my literary level long ago, and seeing that it is not a high
one there would seem to be a certain affectation, even a
certain dishonesty, in making it seem higher than it is by
republication of my best only. Of course I have not carried
out this plan so consistently as to make the book dull: I
had to "draw the line" at that.</p>

<p>I say all this because I don't want you and Sterling to
think that I disdain assistance: I simply decided beforehand
not to avail myself of its obvious advantages. You
would have done as much for the book in one way as you
have done in another.</p>

<p>I'll have to ask you to suggest that Mr. Wood have a man
go over all the matter in the book, and see that none of the
pieces are duplicated, as I fear they are. Reading the titles
will not be enough: I might have given the same piece two
titles. It will be necessary to compare first lines, I think.
That will be drudgery which I'll not ask you to undertake:
some of Wood's men, or some of the printer's men, will do
it as well; it is in the line of their work.</p>

<p>The "Dies Irae" is the most earnest and sincere of religious
poems; my travesty of it is mere solemn fooling, which
fact is "given away" in the prose introduction, where I
speak of my version being of possible service in the church!
The travesty is not altogether unfair&mdash;it was inevitably
suggested by the author's obvious inaccessibility to humor
and logic&mdash;a peculiarity that is, however, observable in all
religious literature, for it is a fundamental necessity to the
religious mind. Without logic and a sense of the ludicrous a
man is religious as certainly as without webbed feet a bird
has the land habit.</p>

<p>It is funny, but I am a "whole lot" more interested in<span class="pagenum">69</span>
seeing your cover of the book than my contents of it. I
don't at all doubt&mdash;since you dared undertake it&mdash;that
your great conception will find a fit interpreter in your
hand; so my feeling is not anxiety. It is just interest&mdash;pure
interest in what is above my powers, but in which <i>you</i> can
work. By the way, Keller, of the old "Wasp" was <i>not</i> the
best of its cartoonists. The best&mdash;the best of <i>all</i> cartoonists
if he had not died at eighteen&mdash;was another German,
named Barkhaus. I have all his work and have long cherished
a wish to republish it with the needed explanatory
text&mdash;much of it being "local" and "transient." Some day,
perhaps&mdash;most likely not. But Barkhaus was a giant.</p>

<p>How I envy you! There are few things that would please
me so well as to "drop in" on you folks in Sterling's camp.
Honestly, I think all that prevents is the (to me) killing
journey by rail. And two months would be required, going
and returning by sea. But the rail trip across the continent
always gives me a horrible case of asthma, which lasts for
weeks. I shall never take <i>that</i> journey again if I can avoid
it. What times you and they will have about the campfire
and the table! I feel like an exile, though I fear I don't look
and act the part.</p>

<p>I did not make the little excursion I was about to take
when I wrote you recently. Almost as I posted the letter I
was taken ill and have not been well since.</p>

<p>Poor Doyle! how thoughtful of him to provide for the
destruction of my letters! But I fear Mrs. Doyle found
some of them queer reading&mdash;if she read them.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Great Scott! if ever they begin to publish mine there will
be a circus! For of course the women will be the chief sinners,
and&mdash;well, they have material a-plenty; they can<span class="pagenum">70</span>
make many volumes, and your poor dead friend will have
so bad a reputation that you'll swear you never knew him.
I dare say, though, you have sometimes been indiscreet,
too. <i>My</i> besetting sin has been in writing to my girl friends
as if they were sweethearts&mdash;the which they'll doubtless
not be slow to affirm. The fact that they write to me in the
same way will be no defense; for when I'm worm's meat I
can't present the proof&mdash;and wouldn't if I could. Maybe it
won't matter&mdash;if I don't turn in my grave and so bother
the worms.</p>

<p>As Doyle's "literary executor" I fear your duties will be
light: he probably did not leave much manuscript. I judge
from his letters that he was despondent about his work and
the narrow acceptance that it had. So I assume that he did
not leave much more than the book of poems, which no
publisher would (or will) take.</p>

<p>You are about to encounter the same stupid indifference
of the public&mdash;so is Sterling. I'm sure of Sterling, but don't
quite know how it will affect <i>you</i>. You're a pretty sturdy
fellow, physically and mentally, but this <i>may</i> hurt horribly.
I pray that it do not, and could give you&mdash;perhaps have
given you&mdash;a thousand reasons why it <i>should</i> not. You are
still young and your fame may come while you live; but
you must not expect it now, and doubtless do not. To me,
and I hope to you, the approval of one person who knows
is sweeter than the acclaim of ten thousand who do not&mdash;whose
acclaim, indeed, I would rather not have. If you do
not <i>feel</i> this in every fibre of your brain and heart, try to
learn to feel it&mdash;practice feeling it, as one practices some
athletic feat necessary to health and strength.</p>

<p>Thank you very much for the photograph. You are growing
too infernally handsome to be permitted to go about<span class="pagenum">71</span>
unchained. If I had your "advantages" of youth and comeliness
I'd go to the sheriff and ask him to lock me up. That
would be the honorable thing for you to do, if you don't
mind. God be with you&mdash;but inattentive.</p>

<p>I fear that among the various cares incident to my departure
from Washington I forgot, or neglected, to acknowledge
the Joaquin Miller book that you kindly sent me. I
was glad to have it. It has all his characteristic merits and
demerits&mdash;among the latter, his interminable prolixity, the
thinness of the thought, his endless repetition of favorite
words and phrases, many of them from his other poems, his
mispronunciation, his occasional flashes of prose, and so forth.</p>

<p>Scheff tells me his book is out and mine nearly out. But
what of yours? I do fear me it never will be out if you rely
upon its "acceptance" by any American publisher. If it
meets with no favor among the publisher tribe we must
nevertheless get it out; and you will of course let me do what
I can. That is only tit for tat. But tell me about it.</p>

<p>I dare say Scheff, who is clever at getting letters out of
me&mdash;the scamp!&mdash;has told you of my being up here atop
of the Alleghenies, and why I <i>am</i> here. I'm having a rather
good time. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Can you fancy me playing croquet, cards,
lawn&mdash;no, thank God, I've escaped lawn tennis and golf!
In respect of other things, though, I'm a glittering specimen
of the Summer Old Man.</p>

<p>Did <i>you</i> have a good time in the redwoods?</p>

<p>Please present my compliments to Madame (and Mademoiselle)
Sterling. Sincerely yours, <span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Dear Sterling</span>,<span class="pagenum">72</span></p>

<p>I return the verses with a few suggestions.</p>

<p>I'm sorry your time for poetry is so brief. But take your
pencil and figure out how much you would write in thirty
years (I hope you'll live that long) at, say, six lines a day.
You'll be surprised by the result&mdash;and encouraged. Remember
that 50,000 words make a fairly long book.</p>

<p>You make me shudder when you say you are reading the
"Prattle" of years. I haven't it and should hardly dare to
read it if I had. There is so much in it to deplore&mdash;so much
that is not wise&mdash;so much that was the expression of a
mood or a whim&mdash;so much was not altogether sincere&mdash;so
many half-truths, and so forth. Make allowances, I beg,
and where you cannot, just forgive.</p>

<p>Scheff has mentioned his great desire that you join the
Bohemian Club. I know he wants me to advise you to do
so. So I'm between two fires and would rather not advise
at all. There are advantages (obvious enough) in belonging;
and to one of your age and well grounded in sobriety
and self-restraint generally, the disadvantages are not so
great as to a youngster like Scheff. (Of course he is not so
young as he seems to me; but he is younger by a few years
and a whole lot of thought than you.)</p>

<p>The trouble with that kind of club&mdash;with any club&mdash;is
the temptation to waste of time and money; and the
danger of the drink habit. If one is proof against these a
club is all right. I belong to one myself in Washington, and
at one time came pretty near to "running" it.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>No, I don't think Scheff's view of Kipling just. He asked
me about putting that skit in the book. It <i>was</i> his view and,
that being so, I could see no reason for suppressing it in
deference to those who do not hold it. I like free speech,<span class="pagenum">73</span>
though I'd not accord it to my enemies if I were Dictator.
I should not think it for the good of the State to let *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
write verses, for example. The modern fad Tolerance does
not charm me, but since it is all the go I'm willing that my
friends should have their fling.</p>

<p>I dare say Scheff is unconscious of Kipling's paternity in
the fine line in "Back, back to Nature":</p>

<p class="poem">"Loudly to the shore cries the surf upon the sea."</p>

<p>But turn to "The Last Chanty," in "The Seven Seas," fill
your ears with it and you'll write just such a line yourself.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Dear Sterling</span>,</p>

<p>I have yours of the 5th. Before now you have mine of
<i>some</i> date.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I'm glad you like London; I've heard he is a fine fellow
and have read one of his books&mdash;"The Son of the Wolf," I
think is the title&mdash;and it seemed clever work mostly. The
general impression that remains with me is that it is always
winter and always night in Alaska.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* will probably be glad to sell his scrap-book later, to
get bread. He can't make a living out of the labor unions
alone. I wish he were not a demgagoue and would not, as
poor Doyle put it, go a-whoring after their Muse. When he
returns to truth and poetry I'll receive him back into favor
and he may kick me if he wants to.</p>

<p>No, I can't tell you how to get "Prattle"; if I could I'd
not be without it myself. You ask me when I began it in the<span class="pagenum">74</span>
"Examiner." Soon after Hearst got the paper&mdash;I don't
know the date&mdash;they can tell you at the office and will
show you the bound volumes.</p>

<p>I have the bound volumes of the "Argonaut" and "Wasp"
during the years when I was connected with them, but my
work in the "Examiner" (and previously in the "News
Letter" and the London "Fun" and "Figaro" and other
papers) I kept only in a haphazard and imperfect way.</p>

<p>I don't recollect giving Scheff any "epigram" on woman
or anything else. So I can't send it to you. I amuse myself
occasionally with that sort of thing in the "Journal"
("American") and suppose Hearst's other papers copy
them, but the "environment" is uncongenial and uninspiring.</p>

<p>Do I think extracts from "Prattle" would sell? I don't
think anything of mine will sell. I could make a dozen
books of the stuff that I have "saved up"&mdash;have a few
ready for publication now&mdash;but all is vanity so far as profitable
publication is concerned. Publishers want nothing
from me but novels&mdash;and I'll die first.</p>

<p>Who is *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&mdash;and why? It is good of London to defend
me against him. I fancy all you fellows have a-plenty of defending
me to do, though truly it is hardly worth while. All
my life I have been hated and slandered by all manner of
persons except good and intelligent ones; and I don't greatly
mind. I knew in the beginning what I had to expect, and
I know now that, like spanking, it hurts (sometimes) but
does not harm. And the same malevolence that has surrounded
my life will surround my memory if I am remembered.
Just run over in your mind the names of men who
have told the truth about their unworthy fellows and about
human nature "as it was given them to see it." They are<span class="pagenum">75</span>
the bogie-men of history. None of them has escaped vilification.
Can poor little I hope for anything better? When
you strike you are struck. The world is a skunk, but it has
rights; among them that of retaliation. Yes, you deceive
yourself if you think the little fellows of letters "like" you,
or rather if you think they will like you when they know
how big you are. They will lie awake nights to invent new
lies about you and new means of spreading them without
detection. But you have your revenge: in a few years they'll
all be dead&mdash;just the same as if you had killed them. Better
yet, you'll be dead yourself. So&mdash;you have my entire
philosophy in two words: "Nothing matters."</p>

<p>Reverting to Scheff. What he has to fear (if he cares) is
not incompetent criticism, but public indifference. That
does not bite, but poets are an ambitious folk and like the
limelight and the center of the stage. Maybe Scheff is different,
as I know you are. Try to make him so if he isn't.
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Wise poets write for one another. If the public happens
to take notice, well and good. Sometimes it does&mdash;and
then the wise poet would a blacksmith be. But this
screed is becoming an essay.</p>

<p>Please give my love to all good Sterlings&mdash;those by birth
and those by marriage. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>My friends have returned to Washington, and I'm having
great times climbing peaks (they are knobs) and exploring
gulches and cañons&mdash;for which these people have no
names&mdash;poor things. My dreamland is still unrevisited.
They found a Confederate soldier over there the other day,
with his rifle alongside. I'm going over to beg his pardon.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">My dear Sterling</span>,<span class="pagenum">76</span></p>

<p>I have Jack London's books&mdash;the one from you and the
one from him. I thank you and shall find the time to read
them. I've been back but a few days and find a brace of
dozen of books "intitualed" "Shapes of Clay." That the
splendid work done by Scheff and Wood and your other
associates in your labor of love is most gratifying to me
should "go without saying." Surely <i>I</i> am most fortunate
in having so good friends to care for my interests. Still,
there will be an aching void in the heart of me until <i>your</i>
book is in evidence. Honest, I feel more satisfaction in the
work of you and Scheff than in my own. It is through you
two that I expect my best fame. And how generously you
accord it!&mdash;unlike certain others of my "pupils," whom I
have assisted far more than I did you.</p>

<p>My trip through the mountains has done my health
good&mdash;and my heart too. It was a "sentimental journey"
in a different sense from Sterne's. Do you know, George,
the charm of a new emotion? Of course you do, but at my
age I had thought it impossible. Well, I had it repeatedly.
Bedad, I think of going again into my old "theatre of
war," and setting up a cabin there and living the few days
that remain to me in meditation and sentimentalizing. But
I should like you to be near enough to come up some Saturday
night with some'at to drink. Sincerely yours, <span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">My dear Sterling</span>,</p>

<p>I'm indebted to you for two letters&mdash;awfully good ones.
In the last you tell me that your health is better, and I can
see for myself that your spirits are. This you attribute to
exercise, correctly, no doubt. You need a lot of the open
air&mdash;we all do. I can give myself hypochondria in forty-eight<span class="pagenum">77</span>
hours by staying in-doors. The sedentary life and abstracted
contemplation of one's own navel are good for
Oriental gods only. We spirits of a purer fire need sunlight
and the hills. My own recent wanderings afoot and horseback
in the mountains did me more good than a sermon.
And you have "the hills back of Oakland"! God, what
would I not give to help you range them, the dear old things!
Why, I know every square foot of them from Walnut Creek
to Niles Cañon. Of course they swarm with ghosts, as do all
places out there, even the streets of San Francisco; but I
and my ghosts always get on well together. With the female
ones my relations are sometimes a bit better than they were
with the dear creatures when they lived.</p>

<p>I guess I did not acknowledge the splendidly bound
"Shapes" that you kindly sent, nor the Jack London books.
Much thanks.</p>

<p>I'm pleased to know that Wood expects to sell the whole
edition of my book, but am myself not confident of that.</p>

<p>So we are to have your book soon. Good, but I don't like
your indifference to its outward and visible aspect. Some
of my own books have offended, and continue to offend,
in that way. At best a book is not too beautiful; at worst it
is hideous. Be advised a bit by Scheff in this matter; his
taste seems to me admirable and I'm well pleased by his
work on the "Shapes"; even his covers, which I'm sorry to
learn do not please Wood, appear to me excellent. I approved
the design before he executed it&mdash;in fact chose it
from several that he submitted. Its only fault seems to me
too much gold leaf, but that is a fault "on the right side."
In that and all the rest of the work (except my own) experts
here are delighted. I gave him an absolutely free hand
and am glad I did. I don't like the ragged leaves, but he<span class="pagenum">78</span>
does not either, on second thought. The public&mdash;the reading
public&mdash;I fear does, just now.</p>

<p>I'll get at your new verses in a few days. It will be, as always
it is, a pleasure to go over them.</p>

<p>About "Prattle." I should think you might get help in
that matter from Oscar T. Schuck, 2916 Laguna St. He
used to suffer from "Prattle" a good deal, but is very
friendly, and the obtaining it would be in the line of his
present business.</p>

<p>How did you happen to hit on Markham's greatest two
lines&mdash;but I need not ask that&mdash;from "The Wharf of
Dreams"?</p>

<p>Well, I wish I could think that those lines of mine in
"Geotheos" were worthy to be mentioned with Keats'
"magic casements" and Coleridge's "woman wailing for
her demon lover." But I don't think any lines of anybody
are. I laugh at myself to remember that Geotheos, never
before in print I believe, was written for E. L. G. Steele to
read before a "young ladies' seminary" somewhere in the
cow counties! Like a man of sense he didn't read it. I don't
share your regret that I have not devoted myself to serious
poetry. I don't think of myself as a poet, but as a satirist;
so I'm entitled to credit for what little gold there may be
in the mud I throw. But if I professed gold-throwing, the
mud which I should surely mix with the missiles would
count against me. Besides, I've a preference for being the
first man in a village, rather than the second man in Rome.
Poetry is a ladder on which there is now no room at the
top&mdash;unless you and Scheff throw down some of the chaps
occupying the upper rung. It looks as if you might, but I
could not. When old Homer, Shakspeare and that crowd&mdash;building
better than Ozymandias&mdash;say: "Look on my<span class="pagenum">79</span>
works, ye mighty, and despair!" I, considering myself specially
addressed, despair. The challenge of the wits does
not alarm me.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>As to your problems in grammar.</p>

<p>If you say: "There is no hope <i>or</i> fear" you say that <i>one</i>
of them does not exist. In saying: "There is no hope <i>nor</i>
fear" you say that <i>both</i> do not exist&mdash;which is what you
mean.</p>

<p>"Not to weary you, I shall say that I fetched the book
from his cabin." Whether that is preferable to "I will say"
depends on just what is meant; both are grammatical. The
"shall" merely indicates an intention to say; the "will"
implies a certain shade of concession in saying it.</p>

<p>It is no trouble to answer such questions, <i>nor</i> to do anything
else to please you. I only hope I make it clear.</p>

<p>I don't know if all my "Journal" work gets into the
"Examiner," for I don't see all the issues of either paper.
I'm not writing much anyhow. They don't seem to want
much from me, and their weekly check is about all that I
want from them.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>No, I don't know any better poem of Kipling than "The
Last Chanty." Did you see what stuff of his Prof. Harry
Thurston Peck, the Hearst outfit's special literary censor,
chose for a particular commendation the other day? Yet
Peck is a scholar, a professor of Latin and a writer of merited
distinction. Excepting the ability to write poetry, the
ability to understand it is, I think, the rarest of intellectual
gifts. Let us thank "whatever gods may be" that we have
it, if we haven't so very much else.</p>

<p>I've a lovely birch stick a-seasoning for you&mdash;cut it up<span class="pagenum">80</span>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Dear George</span>,</p>

<p>I return the verses&mdash;with apology for tardiness. I've been
"full up" with cares.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I would not change "Religion" to "Dogma" (if I were
you) for all "the pious monks of St. Bernard." Once you
begin to make concessions to the feelings of this person or
that there is no place to stop and you may as well hang up
the lyre. Besides, Dogma does not "seek"; it just impudently
declares something to have been found. However,
it is a small matter&mdash;nothing can destroy the excellence of
the verses. I only want to warn you against yielding to a
temptation which will assail you all your life&mdash;the temptation
to "edit" your thought for somebody whom it may
pain. Be true to Truth and let all stand from under.</p>

<p>Yes, I think the quatrain that you wrote in Col. Eng's
book good enough to go in your own. But I'd keep "discerning,"
instead of substituting "revering." In art discernment
<i>carries</i> reverence.</p>

<p><i>Of course</i> I expect to say something of Scheff's book, but
in no paper with which I have a present connection can I
regularly "review" it. Hearst's papers would give it incomparably
the widest publicity, but they don't want "reviews"
from me. They have Millard, who has already reviewed
it&mdash;right well too&mdash;and Prof. Peck&mdash;who possibly
might review it if it were sent to him. "Prof. Harry Thurston
Peck, care of 'The American,' New York City." Mention
it to Scheff. I'm trying to find out what I can do.</p>

<p>I'm greatly pleased to observe your ability to estimate<span class="pagenum">81</span>
the relative value of your own poems&mdash;a rare faculty. "To
Imagination" is, <i>I</i> think, the best of all your short ones.</p>

<p>I'm impatient for the book. It, too, I shall hope to write
something about. Sincerely yours, <span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Dear George</span>,</p>

<p>A thousand cares have prevented my writing to you&mdash;and
Scheff. And this is to be a "busy day." But I want to say
that I've not been unmindful of your kindness in sending
the book&mdash;which has hardly left my pocket since I got it.
And I've read nothing in it more than once, excepting the
"Testimony." <i>That</i> I've studied, line by line&mdash;and "precept
by precept"&mdash;finding in it always "something rich
and strange." It is greater than I knew; it is the greatest
"ever"!</p>

<p>I'm saying a few words about it in tomorrow's "American"&mdash;would
that I had a better place for what I say and
more freedom of saying. But they don't want, and won't
have, "book reviews" from me; probably because I will
not undertake to assist their advertising publishers. So I
have to disguise my remarks and work up to them as parts
of another topic. In this case I have availed myself of my
favorite "horrible example," Jim Riley, who ought to be
proud to be mentioned on the same page with you. After
all, the remarks may not appear; I have the <i>littlest</i> editor
that ever blue-penciled whatever he thought particularly
dear to the writer. I'm here for only a few days, I hope.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I want to say that you seem to me greatest when you
have the greatest subject&mdash;not flowers, women and all
that,&mdash;but something above the flower-and-woman belt&mdash;something
that you see from altitudes from which <i>they</i> are unseen<span class="pagenum">82</span>
and unsmelled. Your poetry is incomparable with that
of our other poets, but your thought, philosophy,&mdash;that is
greater yet. But I'm writing this at a desk in the reading
room of a hotel; when I get home I'll write you again.</p>

<p>I'm concerned about your health, of which I get bad reports.
Can't you go to the mesas of New Mexico and round
up cattle for a year or two&mdash;or do anything that will permit,
or compel, you to sleep out-of-doors under your favorite
stars&mdash;something that will <i>not</i> permit you to enter a
house for even ten minutes? You say no. Well, some day
you'll <i>have</i> to&mdash;when it is too late&mdash;like Peterson, my
friend Charley Kaufman and so many others, who might
be living if they had gone into that country in time and
been willing to make the sacrifice when it would have done
good. You can go <i>now</i> as well as <i>then</i>; and if now you'll
come back well, if then, you'll not only sacrifice your salary,
"prospects," and so forth, but lose your life as well. I <i>know</i>
that kind of life would cure you. I've talked with dozens of
men whom it did cure.</p>

<p>You'll die of consumption if you don't. Twenty-odd years
ago I was writing articles on the out-of-doors treatment for
consumption. Now&mdash;only just now&mdash;the physicians are
doing the same, and establishing out-of-door sanitaria for
consumption.</p>

<p>You'll say you haven't consumption. I don't say that you
have. But you will have if you listen to yourself saying: "I
can't do it." *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Pardon me, my friend, for this rough advice as to your
personal affairs: I am greatly concerned about you. Your life
is precious to me and to the world. Sincerely yours, <span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">My dear George</span>,</p>

<p>Thank you so much for the books and the inscription&mdash;which<span class="pagenum">83</span>
(as do all other words of praise) affects me with a sad
sense of my shortcomings as writer and man. Things of
that kind from too partial friends point out to me with a
disquieting significance what I ought to be; and the contrast
with what I am hurts. Maybe you feel enough that
way sometimes to understand. You are still young enough
to profit by the pain; <i>my</i> character is made&mdash;<i>my</i> opportunities
are gone. But it does not greatly matter&mdash;nothing
does. I have some little testimony from you and Scheff and
others that I have not lived altogether in vain, and I know
that I have greater satisfaction in my slight connection
with your and their work than in my own. Also a better
claim to the attention and consideration of my fellow-men.</p>

<p>Never mind about the "slow sale" of my book; I did not
expect it to be otherwise, and my only regret grows out of
the fear that some one may lose money by the venture. <i>It
is not to be you.</i> You know I am still a little "in the dark" as
to what <i>you</i> have really done in the matter. I wish you
would tell me if any of your own money went into it. The
contract with Wood is all right; it was drawn according to
my instructions and I shall not even accept the small royalty
allowed me if anybody is to be "out." If <i>you</i> are to be
out I shall not only not accept the royalty, but shall reimburse
you to the last cent. Do you mind telling me about
all that? In any case don't "buy out Wood" and don't pay
out anything for advertising nor for anything else.</p>

<p>The silence of the reviewers does not trouble me, any
more than it would you. Their praise of my other books
never, apparently, did me any good. No book published in
this country ever received higher praise from higher sources
than my first collection of yarns. But the book was never a<span class="pagenum">84</span>
"seller," and doubtless never will be. That <i>I</i> like it fairly
well is enough. You and I do not write books to sell; we
write&mdash;or rather publish&mdash;just because we like to. We've
no right to expect a profit from fun.</p>

<p>It is odd and amusing that you could have supposed that
I had any other reason for not writing to you than a fixed
habit of procrastination, some preoccupation with my
small affairs and a very burdensome correspondence. Probably
you <i>could</i> give me a grievance by trying hard, but if
you ever are conscious of not having tried you may be sure
that I haven't the grievance.</p>

<p>I should have supposed that the author of "Viverols"
and several excellent monographs on fish would have understood
your poems. (O no; I don't mean that your Muse
is a mermaid.) Perhaps he did, but you know how temperate
of words men of science are by habit. Did you send a
book to Garrett Serviss? I should like to know what he
thinks of the "Testimony." As to Joaquin, it is his detestable
habit, as it was Longfellow's, to praise all poetry submitted
to him, and he said of Madge Morris's coyote poem
the identical thing that he says of your work. Sorry to disillusionize
you, but it is so.</p>

<p>As to your health. You give me great comfort.*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* But it
was not only from Scheff that I had bad accounts of you and
"your cough." Scheff, indeed, has been reticent in the
matter, but evidently anxious; and you yourself have
written despondently and "forecasted" an early passing
away. If nothing is the matter with you and your lungs
some of your friends are poor observers. I'm happy to have
your testimony, and beg to withdraw my project for your recovery.
You whet my appetite for that new poem. The lines</p>

<p class="poem">
<span class="o1">"The blue-eyed vampire, sated at her feast,</span><br /><span class="pagenum">85</span>

<p>You should not be irritated by the "conspiracy of silence"
about me on the part of the "Call," the "Argonaut" and
other papers. Really my enemies are under no obligation to
return good for evil; I fear I should not respect them if they
did. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*, his head still sore from my many beatings of
that "distracted globe," would be a comic figure stammering
his sense of my merit and directing attention to the excellence
of the literary wares on my shelf.</p>

<p>As to the pig of a public, its indifference to a diet of pearls&mdash;<i>our</i>
pearls&mdash;was not unknown to me, and truly it does not
trouble me anywhere except in the pocket. <i>That</i> pig, too, is
not much beholden to me, who have pounded the snout of
it all my life. Why should it assist in the rite? Its indifference
to <i>your</i> work constitutes a new provocation and
calls for added whacks, but not its indifference to mine.</p>

<p>The Ashton Stevens interview was charming. His finding
you and Scheff together seems too idyllic to be true&mdash;I
thought it a fake. He put in quite enough&mdash;too much&mdash;about
me. As to Joaquin's hack at me&mdash;why, that was
magnanimity itself in one who, like most of us, does not
offset blame against praise, subtract the latter from the
former and find matter for thanks in the remainder. You
know "what fools we mortals be"; criticism that is not all
honey is all vinegar. Nobody has more delighted than I in
pointing out the greatness of Joaquin's great work; but nobody
than I has more austerely condemned *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*, his vanity<span class="pagenum">86</span>
and the general humbugery that makes his prose so insupportable.
Joaquin is a good fellow, all the same, and you
should not demand of him impossible virtues and a reach of
reasonableness that is alien to him.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>And the poem!<a name="fnanchor_7" id="fnanchor_7"></a><a href="#footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> I hardly know how to speak of it. No
poem in English of equal length has so bewildering a wealth
of imagination. Not Spenser himself has flung such a profusion
of jewels into so small a casket. Why, man, it takes
away the breath! I've read and reread&mdash;read it for the expression
and read it for the thought (always when I speak
of the "thought" in your work I mean the meaning&mdash;which
is another thing) and I shall read it many times more.
And pretty soon I'll get at it with my red ink and see if I
can suggest anything worth your attention. I fear not.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Dear George</span>,</p>

<p>I wrote you yesterday. Since then I have been rereading
your letter. I wish you would not say so much about what I
have done for you, and how much it was worth to you, and
all that. I should be sorry to think that I did not do a little
for you&mdash;I tried to. But, my boy, you should know that I
don't keep that kind of service <i>on sale</i>. Moreover, I'm
amply repaid by what <i>you</i> have done for <i>me</i>&mdash;I mean with<span class="pagenum">87</span>
your pen. Do you suppose <i>I</i> do not value such things?
Does it seem reasonable to think me unpleasured by those
magnificent dedicatory verses in your book? Is it nothing
to me to be called "Master" by such as you? Is my nature
so cold that I have no pride in such a pupil? There is no
obligation in the matter&mdash;certainly none that can be suffered
to satisfy itself out of your pocket.</p>

<p>You greatly overestimate the sums I spend in "charity."
I sometimes help some poor devil of an unfortunate over
the rough places, but not to the extent that you seem to
suppose. I couldn't&mdash;I've too many regular, constant,
<i>legitimate</i> demands on me. Those, mostly, are what keep
me poor.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Maybe you think it odd that I've not said a word in print
about any of your work except the "Testimony." It is not
that I don't appreciate the minor poems&mdash;I do. But I don't
like to scatter; I prefer to hammer on a single nail&mdash;to
push one button until someone hears the bell. When the
"Wine" is published I'll have another poem that is not
only great, but striking&mdash;notable&mdash;to work on. However
good, or even great, a short poem with such a title as
"Poesy," "Music," "To a Lily," "A White Rose," and so
forth, cannot be got into public attention. Some longer and
more notable work, of the grander manner, may <i>carry</i> it,
but of itself it will not go. Even a bookful of its kind will
not. Not till you're famous.</p>

<p>Your letter regarding your brother (who has not turned
up) was needless&mdash;I could be of no assistance in procuring
him employment. I've tried so often to procure it for others,
and so vainly, that nobody could persuade me to try any
more. I'm not fond of the character of suppliant, nor of<span class="pagenum">88</span>
being "turned down" by the little men who run this Government.
Of course I'm not in favor with this Administration,
not only because of my connection with Democratic
newspapers, but because, also, I sometimes venture to dissent
openly from the doctrine of the divinity of those in
high station&mdash;particularly Teddy.</p>

<p>I'm sorry you find your place in the office intolerable.
That is "the common lot of all" who work for others. I
have chafed under the yoke for many years&mdash;a heavier
yoke, I think, than yours. It does not fit my neck anywhere.
Some day perhaps you and I will live on adjoining ranches
in the mountains&mdash;or in adjoining caves&mdash;"the world forgetting,
by the world forgot." I have really been on the
point of hermitizing lately, but I guess I'll have to continue
to live like a reasonable human being a little longer until I
can release myself with a conscience void of offense to my
creditors and dependents. But "the call of the wild"
sounds, even in my dreams.</p>

<p>You ask me if you should write in "A Wine of Wizardry"
vein, or in that of "The Testimony of the Suns." Both. I
don't know in which you have succeeded the better. And I
don't know anyone who has succeeded better in either. To
succeed in both is a marvelous performance. You may say
that the one is fancy, the other imagination, which is true,
but not the whole truth. The "Wine" has as true imagination
as the other, and fancy into the bargain. I like your
grandiose manner, and I like the other as well. In terms of
another art I may say&mdash;rear great towers and domes.
Carve, also, friezes. But I'd not bother to cut single finials
and small decorations. However exquisite the workmanship,
they are not worth your present attention. If you
were a painter (as, considering your wonderful sense of<span class="pagenum">89</span>
color, you doubtless could have been) your large canvases
would be your best.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I don't care if that satire of Josephare refers to me or not;
it was good. He may jump on me if he wants to&mdash;I don't
mind. All I ask is that he do it well.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I passed yesterday with Percival Pollard, viewing the
burnt district of Baltimore. He's a queer duck whom I like,
and he likes your work. I'm sending you a copy of "The
Papyrus," with his "rehabilitation" of the odious Oscar
Wilde. Wilde's work is all right, but what can one do with
the work of one whose name one cannot speak before
women?</p>

<p>The "belatedness" of your letter only made <i>me</i> fear that
<i>I</i> had offended <i>you</i>. Odd that we should have such views of
each other's sensitiveness.</p>

<p>About Wood. No doubt that he is doing all that he can,
but&mdash;well, he is not a publisher. For example: He sent
forty or fifty "Shapes" here. They lie behind a counter at
the bookseller's&mdash;not even <i>on</i> the counter. There are probably
not a dozen persons of my acquaintance in Washington
who know that I ever wrote a book. Now <i>how</i> are even
these to know about <i>that</i> book? The bookseller does not advertise
the books he has on sale and the public does not go
rummaging behind his counters. A publisher's methods are
a bit different, naturally.</p>

<p>Only for your interest I should not care if my books sold<span class="pagenum">90</span>
or not; they exist and will not be destroyed; every book will
eventually get to <i>somebody</i>.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>It seems to be a matter for you to determine&mdash;whether
Wood continues to try to sell the book or it is put in other
hands if he is ever tired of it. Remember, I don't care a rap
what happens to the book except as a means of reimbursing
you; I want no money and I want no glory. If you and
Wood can agree, do in all things as you please.</p>

<p>I return Wood's letters; they show what I knew before:
that the public and the librarians would not buy that book.
Let us discuss this matter no more, but at some time in
the future you tell me how much you are out of pocket.</p>

<p><i>Your</i> book shows that a fellow can get a good deal of glory
with very little profit. You are now famous&mdash;at least on
the Pacific Coast; but I fancy you are not any "for'arder"
in the matter of wealth than you were before. I too have
some reputation&mdash;a little wider, as yet, than yours. Well, my
work sells tremendously&mdash;in Mr. Hearst's newspapers, at
the price of a small fraction of one cent! Offered by itself, in
one-dollar and two-dollar lots, it tempts nobody to fall over
his own feet in the rush to buy. A great trade, this of ours!</p>

<p>I note with interest the "notices" you send. The one by
Monahan is amusing with its gabble about your "science."
To most men, as to him, a mention of the stars suggests
astronomy, with its telescopes, spectroscopes and so forth.
Therefore it is "scientific." To tell such men that there is
nothing of science in your poem would puzzle them greatly.</p>

<p>I don't think poor Lang meant to do anything but his
best and honestest. He is a rather clever and rather small
fellow and not to be blamed for the limitations of his insight.
I have repeatedly pointed out in print that it requires<span class="pagenum">91</span>
genius to discern genius at first hand. Lang has written
almost the best, if not quite the best, sonnet in the language&mdash;yet
he is no genius.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Why, of course&mdash;why should you not help the poor devil,
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*; I used to help him myself&mdash;introduced him to the
public and labored to instruct him. Then&mdash;but it is unspeakable
and so is he. He will bite your hand if you feed
him, but I think I'd throw a crust to him myself.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>No, I don't agree with you about Homer, nor "stand for"
your implied view that narrative poetry is not "pure
poetry." Poetry seems to me to speak with a thousand
voices&mdash;"a various language." The miners have a saying:
"Gold is where you find it." So is poetry; I'm expecting to
find it some fine day in the price list of a grocery store. I
fancy <i>you</i> could put it there.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>As to Goethe, the more you read him, the better you
will love Heine.</p>

<p>Thank you for "A Wine of Wizardry"&mdash;amended. It
seems to me that the fake dictum of "Merlin-sage" (I don't
quite perceive the necessity of the hyphen) is better than
the hackneyed Scriptural quotation. It is odd, but my
recollection is that it was the "sick enchantress" who cried
"unto Betelgeuse a mystic word." Was it not so in the copy
that I first had, or do I think so merely because the cry of
one is more lone and awful than the cry of a number?</p>

<p>I am still of the belief that the poem should have at least
a few breaks in it, for I find myself as well as the public
more or less&mdash;I, doubtless, less than the public&mdash;indisposed
to tackle solid columns of either verse or prose. I told<span class="pagenum">92</span>
you this poem "took away one's breath,"&mdash;give a fellow,
can't you, a chance to recover it now and again.</p>

<p class="poem">"Space to breathe, how short soever."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, not my will but thine be done, on earth as it
is in San Francisco. Sincerely yours, <span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Dear George</span>,</p>

<p>To begin at the beginning, I shall of course be pleased to
meet Josephare if he come this way; if only to try to solve
the problem of what is in a fellow who started so badly and
in so short a time was running well, with a prospect of
winning "a place." Byron, you know, was the same way
and Tennyson not so different. Still their start was not so
bad as Josephare's. I freely confess that I thought him a
fool. It is "one on me."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I wonder if a London house would publish "Shapes of
Clay." Occasionally a little discussion about me breaks out
in the London press, blazes up for a little while and "goes
up in smoke." I enclose some evidences of the latest one&mdash;which
you may return if you remember to do so. The letter
of "a deeply disappointed man" was one of rollicking
humor suggested by some articles of Barr about me and a
private intimation from him that I should publish some
more books in London.</p>

<p>Yes, I've dropped "The Passing Show" again, for the
same old reason&mdash;wouldn't stand the censorship of my
editor. I'm writing for the daily issues of The American,
mainly, and, as a rule, anonymously. It's "dead easy"
work.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>It is all right&mdash;that "cry unto Betelgeuse"; the "sick enchantress"<span class="pagenum">93</span>
passage is good enough without it. I like the
added lines of the poem. Here's another criticism: The
"Without" and "Within," beginning the first and third
lines, respectively, <i>seem</i> to be antithetic, when they are not,
the latter having the sense of "into," which I think might,
for clearness, be substituted for it without a displeasing
break of the metre&mdash;a trochee for an iambus.</p>

<p>Why should I not try "The Atlantic" with this poem?&mdash;if
you have not already done so. I could write a brief note
about it, saying what <i>you</i> could not say, and possibly winning
attention to the work. If you say so I will. It is impossible
to imagine a magazine editor rejecting that amazing
poem. I have read it at least twenty times with ever increasing
admiration.</p>

<p>Your book, by the way, is still my constant companion&mdash;I
carry it in my pocket and read it over and over, in the
street cars and everywhere. <i>All</i> the poems are good, though
the "Testimony" and "Memorial Day" are supreme&mdash;the
one in grandeur, the other in feeling.</p>

<p>I send you a criticism in a manuscript letter from a friend
who complains of your "obscurity," as many have the candor
to do. It requires candor to do that, for the fault is in
the critic's understanding. Still, one who understands Shakspeare
and Milton is not without standing as a complaining
witness in the court of literature.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>My favorite translation of Homer is that of Pope, of
whom it is the present fashion to speak disparagingly, as it
is of Byron. I know all that can be said against them, and
say <i>some</i> of it myself, but I wish their detractors had a little
of their brains. I know too that Pope's translations of The
Iliad and The Odyssey are rather paraphrases than translations.<span class="pagenum">94</span>
But I love them just the same, while wondering
(with you, doubtless) what so profoundly affected Keats
when he "heard Chapman speak out loud and bold." Whatever
it was, it gave us what Coleridge pronounced the best
sonnet in our language; and Lang's admiration of Homer
has given us at least the next best. Of course there must be
something in poems that produce poems&mdash;in a poet whom
most poets confess their king. I hold (with Poe) that there
is no such thing as a <i>long</i> poem&mdash;a poem of the length of an
Epic. It must consist of poetic passages connected by <i>recitativo</i>,
to use an opera word; but it is perhaps better for that.
If the writer cannot write "sustained" poetry the reader
probably could not read it. Anyhow, I vote for Homer.</p>

<p>I am passing well, but shall soon seek the mountains,
though I hope to be here when Scheff points his prow this
way. Would that you were sailing with him!</p>

<p>I've been hearing all about all of you, for Eva Crawford
has been among you "takin' notes," and Eva's piquant
comments on what and whom she sees are delicious reading.
I should suppose that <i>you</i> would appreciate Eva&mdash;most
persons don't. She is the best letter writer of her sex&mdash;who
are all good letter writers&mdash;and she is much beside. I
may venture to whisper that you'd find her estimate of
your work and personality "not altogether displeasing."</p>

<p>Now that I'm about such matters, I shall enclose a note
to my friend Dr. Robertson, who runs an insanery at Livermore
and is an interesting fellow with a ditto family and a
library that will make you pea-green with envy. Go out
and see him some day and take Scheff, or any friend, along&mdash;he
wants to know you. You won't mind the facts that he
thinks all poetry the secretion of a diseased brain, and that
the only reason he doesn't think all brains (except his own)<span class="pagenum">95</span>
diseased is the circumstance that not all secrete poetry.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Seriously, he is a good fellow and full of various knowledges
that most of us wot not of.</p>

<p>I have a letter from *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*, who is in St. Louis, to which
his progress has been more leisurely than I liked, considering
that I am remaining away from my mountains only to
meet him. However, he intimates an intention to come in a

<p>I am sending the W. of W. to Scribner's, as you suggest,
and if it is not taken shall try the other mags in the order

Be assured the illustrations will shock you if you

The most <i>contented</i> years of my life lately were the two or

not a soul of them buys and reads my books some of them
bore me insupportably with their ignorant compliments

<p>I haven't written a letter, except on business, since leaving

there. I now return to earth, and my first call is on you.</p>

<p>First, thank you for the knife and the distinction of membership
in the Ancient and Honorable Order of Knifers. I
have made little use of the blades and other appliances, but
the corkscrew is in constant use.</p>

<p>I'm enclosing a little missive from the editor of <i>Harper's</i>.
Please reserve these things awhile and sometime I may ask
them of you to "point a moral or adorn a tale" about that
poem. If we can't get it published I'd like to write for some
friendly periodical a review of an unpublished poem, with
copious extracts and a brief history of it. I think that would
be unique.</p>

<p>I find the pictures of Marian interesting, but have the self-denial
to keep only one of them&mdash;the prettiest one of course.
Your own is rather solemn, but it will do for the title page
of the Testimony, which is still my favorite reading.</p>

<p>Scheff showed me your verses on Katie's baby, and Katie
has since sent them. They are very tender and beautiful. I
would not willingly spare any of your "personal" poems&mdash;least
of all, naturally, the one personal to me. Your success
with them is exceptional. Yet the habit of writing them is<span class="pagenum">98</span>
perilous, as the many failures of great poets attest&mdash;Milton,
for example, in his lines to Syriack Skinner, his lines
to a baby that died a-bornin' and so forth. The reason is
obvious, and you have yourself, with sure finger, pointed
it out:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span class="o1">"Remiss the ministry they bear</span><br />
<span class="i1">Who serve her with divided heart;</span><br />
<span class="i1">She stands reluctant to impart</span><br />
Her strength to purpose, end, or care."</p>

<p>When one is intent upon pleasing some mortal, one is less
intent upon pleasing the immortal Muse. All this is said
only by way of admonition for the future, not in criticism
of the past. I'm a sinner myself in that way, but then I'm
not a saint in any way, so my example doesn't count.</p>

<p>I don't mind *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* calling me a "dignified old gentleman"&mdash;indeed,
that is what I have long aspired to be, but have
succeeded only in the presence of strangers, and not always
then. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>(I forgot to say that your poem is now in the hands of the
editor of the Atlantic.)</p>

<p>Your determination to "boom" me almost frightens me.
Great Scott! you've no notion of the magnitude of the task
you undertake; the labors of Hercules were as nothing to
it. Seriously, don't make any enemies that way; it is not
worth while. And you don't know how comfortable I am in
my obscurity. It is like being in "the shadow of a great
rock in a weary land."</p>

<p>How goes the no sale of Shapes of Clay? I am slowly saving
up a bit of money to recoup your friendly outlay.
That's a new thing for me to do&mdash;the saving, I mean&mdash;and
I rather enjoy the sensation. If it results in making a
miser of me you will have to answer for it to many a<span class="pagenum">99</span>
worthy complainant.</p>

<p>Get thee behind me, Satan!&mdash;it is not possible for me to
go to California yet. For one thing, my health is better here
in the East; I have utterly escaped asthma this summer,
and summer is my only "sickly season" here. In California
I had the thing at any time o' year&mdash;even at Wright's.
But it is my hope to end my days out there.</p>

<p>I don't think Millard was too hard on Kipling; it was no
"unconscious" plagiarism; just a "straight steal."</p>

<p>About Prentice Mulford. I knew him but slightly and
used to make mild fun of him as "Dismal Jimmy." That
expressed my notion of his character and work, which was
mostly prose platitudes. I saw him last in London, a member
of the Joaquin Miller-Charles Warren Stoddard-Olive
Harper outfit at 11 Museum Street, Bloomsbury Square.
He married there a fool girl named Josie&mdash;forget her other
name&mdash;with whom I think he lived awhile in hell, then
freed himself, and some years afterward returned to this
country and was found dead one morning in a boat at Sag
Harbor. Peace to the soul of him. No, he was not a faker,
but a conscientious fellow who mistook his vocation.</p>

<p>My friends have returned to Washington, but I expect to
remain here a few weeks yet, infesting the woods, devastating
the mountain larders, supervising the sunsets and

<p>Your latest was dated Sept. 10. I got it while alone in the
mountains, but since then I have been in New York City
and at West Point and&mdash;here. New York is too strenuous
for me; it gets on my nerves.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Please don't persuade me to come to California&mdash;I mean
don't <i>try</i> to, for I can't, and it hurts a little to say nay.
There's a big bit of my heart there, but&mdash;O never mind the
reasons; some of them would not look well on paper. One of
them I don't mind telling; I would not live in a state under
union labor rule. There is still one place where the honest
American laboring man is not permitted to cut throats and
strip bodies of women at his own sweet will. That is the
District of Columbia.</p>

<p>I am anxious to read Lilith; please complete it.</p>

<p>I have another note of rejection for you. It is from *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.
Knowing that you will not bank on what he says about the
Metropolitan, I enclose it. I've acted on his advising and
sent the poem. It is about time for it to come back. Then I
shall try the other magazines until the list is exhausted.</p>

<p>Did I return your Jinks verses? I know I read them and
meant to send them back, but my correspondence and my
papers are in such hopeless disorder that I'm all at sea on
these matters. For aught I know I may have elaborately
"answered" the letter that I think myself to be answering
now. I liked the verses very temperately, not madly.</p>

<p>Of course you are right about the magazine editors not
knowing poetry when they see it. But who does? I have not
known more than a half-dozen persons in America that
did, and none of them edited a magazine.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>No, I did not write the "Urus-Agricola-Acetes stuff,"<span class="pagenum">101</span>
though it was written <i>for</i> me and, I believe, at my suggestion.
The author was "Jimmy" Bowman, of whose death
I wrote a sonnet which is in Black Beetles. He and I used
to have a lot of fun devising literary mischiefs, fighting
sham battles with each other and so forth. He was a clever
chap and a good judge of whiskey.</p>

<p>Yes, in The Cynic's Dictionary I did "jump from A to
M." I had previously done the stuff in various papers as
far as M, then lost the beginning. So in resuming I re-did
that part (quite differently, of course) in order to have the
thing complete if I should want to make a book of it. I
guess the Examiner isn't running much of it, nor much of
anything of mine.</p>

<p>The "bad eminence" of turning down Sterling's great
poem is one that you will have to share with some of your
esteemed fellow magazinists&mdash;for examples, the editors of
the Atlantic, Harper's, Scribner's, The Century, and now
the Metropolitan, all of the élite. All of these gentlemen, I
believe, profess, as you do not, to know literature when
they see it, and to deal in it.</p>

<p>Well I profess to deal in it in a small way, and if Sterling
will let me I propose some day to ask judgment between
them and me.</p>

<p>Even <i>you</i> ask for literature&mdash;if my stories are literature,
as you are good enough to imply. (By the way, all the leading
publishers of the country turned down that book until<span class="pagenum">102</span>
they saw it published without them by a merchant in San
Francisco and another sort of publishers in London,
Leipzig and Paris.) Well, you wouldn't do a thing to one of
my stories!</p>

<p>No, thank you; if I have to write rot, I prefer to do it for
the newspapers, which make no false pretences and are
frankly rotten, and in which the badness of a bad thing
escapes detection or is forgotten as soon as it is cold.</p>

<p>I know how to write a story (of the "happy ending" sort)
for magazine readers for whom literature is too good, but I
will not do so so long as stealing is more honorable and interesting.</p>

<p>I've offered you the best stuff to be had&mdash;Sterling's
poem&mdash;and the best that I am able to make; and now you
must excuse me. I do not doubt that you really think that
you would take "the kind of fiction that made 'Soldiers
and Civilians' the most readable book of its kind in this
country," and it is nice of you to put it that way; but
neither do I doubt that you would find the story sent a
different kind of fiction and, like the satire which you return
to me, "out of the question." An editor who has a
preformed opinion of the kind of stuff that he is going to get
will always be disappointed with the stuff that he does get.</p>

<p>I know this from my early experience as an editor&mdash;before
I learned that what I needed was, not any particular
kind of stuff, but just the stuff of a particular kind of
writer.</p>

<p>All this without any feeling, and only by way of explaining
why I must ask you to excuse me.</p>

<p>Yes, I got and read that fool thing in the August Critic.
I found in it nothing worse than stupidity&mdash;no malice.
Doubtless you have not sounded the deeper deeps of stupidity
in critics, and so are driven to other motives to
explain their unearthly errors. I know from my own experience
of long ago how hard it is to accept abominable
criticism, obviously (to the criticee) unfair, without attributing
a personal mean motive; but the attribution is nearly
always erroneous, even in the case of a writer with so many
personal enemies as I. You will do well to avoid that weakness
of the tyro. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* has the infirmity in an apparently
chronic form. Poets, by reason of the sensibilities that
<i>make</i> them poets, are peculiarly liable to it. I can't see any
evidence that the poor devil of the Critic knew better.</p>

<p>The Wine of Wizardry is at present at the Booklovers'.
It should have come back ere this, but don't you draw any
happy augury from that: I'm sure they'll turn it down, and
am damning them in advance.</p>

<p>I had a postal from *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* a few days ago. He was in Paris.
I've written him only once, explaining by drawing his attention
to the fact that one's reluctance to write a letter
increases in the ratio of the square of the distance it has to
go. I don't know why that is so, but it is&mdash;at least in my
case.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Yes, I'm in perfect health, barring a bit of insomnia at
times, and enjoy life as much as I ever did&mdash;except when
in love and the love prospering; that is to say, when it was
new.</p>

<p>This is the worst yet! This jobbernowl seems to think<span class="pagenum">104</span>
"The Wine of Wizardry" a story. It should "arrive" and
be "dramatic"&mdash;the denouement being, I suppose, a particularly
exciting example of the "happy ending."</p>

<p>My dear fellow, I'm positively ashamed to throw your
pearls before any more of these swine, and I humbly ask
your pardon for having done it at all. I guess the "Wine"
will have to await the publication of your next book.</p>

<p>But I'd like to keep this fellow's note if you will kindly
let me have it. Sometime, when the poem is published, I
shall paste it into a little scrap book, with all the notes of
rejection, and then if I know a man or two capable of
appreciating the humor of the thing I can make merry over
it with them.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Dear George</span>,</p>

<p>It's a long time since the date of your latest letter, but
I've been doing two men's work for many weeks and have
actually not found the leisure to write to my friends. As it
is the first time that I've worked really hard for several
years I ought not to complain, and don't. But I hope it will
end with this session of Congress.</p>

<p>I think I did not thank you for the additional copies of
your new book&mdash;the new edition. I wish it contained the
new poem, "A Wine of Wizardry." I've given up trying to
get it into anything. I related my failure to Mackay, of
"Success," and he asked to be permitted to see it. "No," I
replied, "you too would probably turn it down, and I will
take no chances of losing the respect that I have for you."
And I'd not show it to him. He declared his intention of
getting it, though&mdash;which was just what I wanted him to<span class="pagenum">105</span>
do. But I dare say he didn't.</p>

<p>Yes, you sent me "The Sea Wolf." My opinion of it?
Certainly&mdash;or a part of it. It is a most disagreeable book,
as a whole. London has a pretty bad style and no sense of
proportion. The story is a perfect welter of disagreeable incidents.
Two or three (of the kind) would have sufficed to
<i>show</i> the character of the man Larsen; and his own self-revealings
by word of mouth would have "done the rest."
Many of these incidents, too, are impossible&mdash;such as that
of a man mounting a ladder with a dozen other men&mdash;more
or less&mdash;hanging to his leg, and the hero's work of rerigging
a wreck and getting it off a beach where it had stuck for
weeks, and so forth. The "love" element, with its absurd
suppressions and impossible proprieties, is awful. I confess
to an overwhelming contempt for both the sexless lovers.</p>

<p>Now as to the merits. It is a rattling good story in one
way; something is "going on" all the time&mdash;not always
what one would wish, but <i>something</i>. One does not go to
sleep over the book. But the great thing&mdash;and it is among
the greatest of things&mdash;is that tremendous creation, Wolf
Larsen. If that is not a permanent addition to literature, it
is at least a permanent figure in the memory of the reader.
You "can't lose" Wolf Larsen. He will be with you to the
end. So it does not really matter how London has hammered
him into you. You may quarrel with the methods,
but the result is almost incomparable. The hewing out and
setting up of such a figure is enough for a man to do in one
life-time. I have hardly words to impart my good judgment
of <i>that</i> work.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>That is a pretty picture of Phyllis as Cleopatra&mdash;whom I
think you used to call "the angel child"&mdash;as the Furies<span class="pagenum">106</span>
were called Eumenides.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I'm enclosing a review of your book in the St. Louis
"Mirror," a paper always kindly disposed toward our little
group of gifted obscurians. I thought you might not have
seen it; and it is worth seeing. Percival Pollard sends it me;
and to him we owe our recognition by the "Mirror."</p>

<p>I hope you prosper apace. I mean mentally and spiritually;
all other prosperity is trash.</p>

<p>I've reached your letter on my file. I wonder that I did,
for truly I'm doing a lot of work&mdash;mostly of the pot-boiler,
newspaper sort, some compiling of future&mdash;probably
<i>very</i> future&mdash;books and a little for posterity.</p>

<p>Valentine has not returned the "Wine of Wizardry," but
I shall tell him to in a few days and will then try it on the
magazines you mention. If that fails I can see no objection
to offering it to the English periodicals.</p>

<p>I don't know about Mackay. He has a trifle of mine which
he was going to run months ago. He didn't and I asked it
back. He returned it and begged that it go back to him for
immediate publication. It went back, but publication did
not ensue. In many other ways he has been exceedingly
kind. Guess he can't always have his way.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I read that other book to the bitter end&mdash;the "Arthur
Sterling" thing. He is the most disagreeable character in
fiction, though Marie Bashkirtseff and Mary McLean in
real life could give him cards and spades. Fancy a poet, or<span class="pagenum">107</span>
any kind of writer, whom it hurts to think! What the devil
are his agonies all about&mdash;his writhings and twistings and
foaming at all his mouths? What would a poem by an intellectual
epileptic like that be? Happily the author spares
us quotation. I suppose there are Arthur Sterlings among
the little fellows, but if genius is not serenity, fortitude and
reasonableness I don't know what it is. One cannot even
imagine Shakespeare or Goethe bleeding over his work and
howling when "in the fell clutch of circumstance." The
great ones are figured in my mind as ever smiling&mdash;a little
sadly at times, perhaps, but always with conscious inaccessibility
to the pinpricking little Titans that would storm
their Olympus armed with ineffectual disasters and pop-gun
misfortunes. Fancy a fellow wanting, like Arthur Sterling,
to be supported by his fellows in order that he may
write what they don't want to read! Even Jack London
would gag at such Socialism as <i>that</i>.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I'm going to pass a summer month or two with the Pollards,
at Saybrook, Conn. How I wish you could be of the
party. But I suppose you'll be chicken-ranching then, and
happy enough where you are. I wish you joy of the venture
and, although I fear it means a meagre living, it will probably
be more satisfactory than doubling over a desk in your
uncle's office. The very name Carmel Bay is enchanting.
I've a notion I shall see that ranch some day. I don't quite
recognize the "filtered-through-the-emasculated-minds-of-about-six-fools"
article from which you say I quote&mdash;don't
remember it, nor remember quoting from it.</p>

<p>I don't wonder at your surprise at my high estimate of
Longfellow in a certain article. It is higher than my permanent
one. I was thinking (while writing for a newspaper,<span class="pagenum">108</span>
recollect) rather of his fame than of his genius&mdash;I had to
have a literary equivalent to Washington or Lincoln. Still,
we must not forget that Longfellow wrote "Chrysaor"
and, in narrative poetry (which you don't care for) "Robert
of Sicily." Must one be judged by his average, or may
he be judged, on occasion, by his highest? He is strongest
who can lift the greatest weight, not he who habitually
lifts lesser ones.</p>

<p>As to your queries. So far as I know, Realf <i>did</i> write his
great sonnets on the night of his death. Anyhow, they were
found with the body. Your recollection that I said they
were written before he came to the Coast is faulty. Some
of his other things were in print when he submitted them
to me (and took pay for them) as new; but not the "De
Mortuis."</p>

<p>I got the lines about the echoes (I <i>think</i> they go this way:</p>

<p class="poem"><span class="i10">"the loon</span><br />
Laughed, and the echoes, huddling in affright,<br />
Like Odin's hounds went baying down the night")<br /></p>

<p>from a poem entitled, I think, "The Washers of the
Shroud." I found it in the "Atlantic," in the summer of
1864, while at home from the war suffering from a wound,
and&mdash;disgraceful fact!&mdash;have never seen nor heard of it
since. If the magazine was a current number, as I suppose,
it should be easy to find the poem. If you look it up tell me
about it. I don't even know the author&mdash;had once a vague
impression that it was Lowell but don't know.</p>

<p>The compound "mulolatry," which I made in "Ashes of
the Beacon," would not, of course, be allowable in composition
altogether serious. I used it because I could not at
the moment think of the right word, "gyneolatry," or
"gynecolatry," according as you make use of the nominative<span class="pagenum">109</span>
or the accusative. I once made "caniolatry" for a
similar reason&mdash;just laziness. It's not nice to do things o'
that kind, even in newspapers.</p>

<p>I had intended to write you something of "beesness," but
time is up and it must wait. This letter is insupportably
long already.</p>

<p>Bailey Millard is editor of "The Cosmopolitan Magazine,"

Hearst that I was in town looked me up. I had just recommended
him to Hearst as editor. He had intended him for

it is. Millard dined with me and I told him the adventures

<p>I'm your debtor for two good long letters. You err in
thinking your letters, of whatever length and frequency,
can be otherwise than delightful to me.</p>

<p>No, you had not before sent me Upton Sinclair's article
explaining why American literature is "bourgeois." It is
amusingly grotesque. The political and economical situation
has about as much to do with it as have the direction
of our rivers and the prevailing color of our hair. But it is of
the nature of the faddist (and of all faddists the ultra socialist
is the most untamed by sense) to see in everything
his hobby, with its name writ large. He is the humorist of
observers. When Sinclair transiently forgets his gospel of
the impossible he can see well enough.</p>

<p>I note what you say of *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and know that he did not use
to like me, though I doubt if he ever had any antipathy to
you. Six or eight years ago I tackled him on a particularly
mean fling that he had made at me while I was absent from
California. (I think I had not met him before.) I told him,
rather coarsely, what I thought of the matter. He candidly
confessed himself in the wrong, expressed regret and has
ever since, so far as I know, been just and even generous<span class="pagenum">111</span>
to me. I think him sincere now, and enclose a letter which
seems to show it. You may return it if you will&mdash;I send it
mainly because it concerns your poem. The trouble&mdash;our
trouble&mdash;with *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* is that he has voluntarily entered into
slavery to the traditions and theories of the magazine
trade, which, like those of all trades, are the product of
small men. The big man makes his success by ignoring
them. Your estimate of *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I'm not disposed to quarrel
with, but do think him pretty square.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Bless you, don't take the trouble to go through the Iliad
and Odyssey to pick out the poetical parts. I grant you
they are brief and infrequent&mdash;I mean in the translation.
I hold, with Poe, that there are no long poems&mdash;only
bursts of poetry in long spinnings of metrical prose. But even
the "recitativo" of the translated Grecian poets has a charm
to one that it may not have to another. I doubt if anyone
who has always loved "the glory that was Greece"&mdash;who
has been always in love with its jocund deities, and
so forth, can say accurately just how much of his joy in
Homer (for example) is due to love of poetry, and how
much to a renewal of mental youth and young illusions.
Some part of the delight that we get from verse defies
analysis and classification. Only a man without a memory
(and memories) could say just what pleased him in poetry
and be sure that it was the poetry only. For example, I
never read the opening lines of the Pope Iliad&mdash;and I don't
need the book for much of the first few hundred, I guess&mdash;without
seeming to be on a sunny green hill on a cold windy
day, with the bluest of skies above me and billows of pasture
below, running to a clean-cut horizon. There's nothing
in the text warranting that illusion, which is nevertheless<span class="pagenum">112</span>
to me a <i>part</i> of the Iliad; a most charming part, too. It all
comes of my having first read the thing under such conditions
at the age of about ten. I <i>remember</i> that; but how
many times I must be powerfully affected by the poets
<i>without</i> remembering why. If a fellow could cut out all that
extrinsic interest he would be a fool to do so. But he would
be a better critic.</p>

<p>You ought to be happy in the contemplation of a natural,
wholesome life at Carmel Bay&mdash;the "prospect pleases,"
surely. But I fear, I fear. Maybe you can get a newspaper
connection that will bring you in a small income without
compelling you to do violence to your literary conscience.
I doubt if you can get your living out of the ground. But I
shall watch the experiment with sympathetic interest, for
it "appeals" to me. I'm a trifle jaded with age and the
urban life, and maybe if you can succeed in that other sort
of thing I could.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>As to *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* the Superb. Isn't Sag Harbor somewhere near
Saybrook, Connecticut, at the mouth of the river of that
name? I'm going there for a month with Percival Pollard.
Shall leave here about the first of July. If Sag Harbor is
easily accessible from there, and *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* would care to see
me, I'll go and call on her. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* But maybe I'd fall in love
with her and, being now (alas) eligible, just marry her
alive!&mdash;or be turned down by her, to the unspeakable
wrecking of my peace! I'm only a youth&mdash;63 on the 24th
of this month&mdash;and it would be too bad if I got started
wrong in life. But really I don't know about the good taste
of being jocular about *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*. I'm sure she must be a serious
enough maiden, with the sun of a declining race yellow
on her hair. Eva Crawford thinks her most lovable&mdash;and<span class="pagenum">113</span>
Eva has a clear, considering eye upon you all.</p>

<p>I have at last the letter that I was waiting for&mdash;didn't
answer the other, for one of mine was on the way to you.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>You need not worry yourself about your part of the business.
You have acted "mighty white," as was to have been
expected of you; and, caring little for any other feature of
the matter, I'm grateful to you for giving my pessimism
and growing disbelief in human disinterestedness a sound
wholesome thwack on the mazzard.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Yes, I was sorry to whack London, for whom, in his character
as author, I have a high admiration, and in that of
publicist and reformer a deep contempt. Even if he had
been a personal friend, I should have whacked him, and
doubtless much harder. I'm not one of those who give their
friends carte blanche to sin. If my friend dishonors himself
he dishonors me; if he makes a fool of himself he makes a
fool of me&mdash;which another cannot do.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Your description of your new environment, in your other
letter, makes me "homesick" to see it. I cordially congratulate
you and Mrs. Sterling on having the sense to do what
I have always been too indolent to do&mdash;namely as you
please. Guess I've been always too busy "warming both<span class="pagenum">114</span>
hands before the fire of life." And now, when</p>

<p class="poem">"It sinks and I am ready to depart,"</p>

<p>I find that the damned fire was in <i>me</i> and ought to have
been quenched with a dash of cold sense. I'm having my
canoe decked and yawl-rigged for deep water and live in
the hope of being drowned according to the dictates of my
conscience.</p>

<p>By way of proving my power of self-restraint I'm going
to stop this screed with a whole page unused.</p>

<p>I have read Mary Austin's book with unexpected interest.
It is pleasing exceedingly. You may not know that I'm
familiar with the <i>kind</i> of country she writes of, and reading
the book was like traversing it again. But the best of her is
her style. That is delicious. It has a slight "tang" of archaism&mdash;just
enough to suggest "lucent sirups tinct with
cinnamon," or the "spice and balm" of Miller's sea-winds.
And what a knack at observation she has! Nothing escapes
her eye. Tell me about her. What else has she written?
What is she going to write? If she is still young she will do
great work; if not&mdash;well, she <i>has</i> done it in that book. But
she'll have to hammer and hammer again and again before
the world will hear and heed.</p>

<p>As to me I'm pot-boiling. My stuff in the N. Y. American<span class="pagenum">115</span>
(I presume that the part of it that you see is in the Examiner)
is mere piffle, written without effort, purpose or care.
My department in the Cosmopolitan is a failure, as I told
Millard it would be. It is impossible to write topical stuff
for a magazine. How can one discuss with heart or inspiration
a thing that happens two months or so before one's
comments on it will be read? The venture and the title
were Hearst's notion, but the title so handicaps me that I
can do nothing right. I shall drop it.</p>

<p>First, about the "Wine," I dislike the "privately printed"
racket. Can you let the matter wait a little longer? Neale
has the poem, and Neale is just now inaccessible to letters,
somewhere in the South in the interest of his magazine-that-is-to-be.
I called when in New York, but he had flown
and I've been unable to reach him; but he is due here on
the 23rd. Then if his mag is going to hold fire, or if he
doesn't want the poem for it, let Robertson or Josephare
have a hack at it.</p>

<p>Barr is amusing. I don't care to have a copy of his remarks.</p>

<p>About the pirating of my stories. That is a matter for
Chatto and Windus, who bought the English copyright of
the book from which that one story came. I dare say,
though, the publication was done by arrangement with
them. Anyhow my interests are not involved.</p>

<p>I was greatly interested in your account of Mrs. Austin.<span class="pagenum">116</span>
She's a clever woman and should write a good novel&mdash;if
there is such a thing as a good novel. I won't read novels.</p>

<p>Yes, the "Cosmopolitan" cat-story is Leigh's and is to
be credited to him if ever published in covers. I fathered it
as the only way to get it published at all. Of course I had
to rewrite it; it was very crude and too horrible. A story
may be terrible, but must not be horrible&mdash;there is a difference.
I found the manuscript among his papers.</p>

<p>It is disagreeable to think of the estrangement between
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and his family. Doubtless the trouble arises from his
being married. Yes, it is funny, his taking his toddy along
with you old soakers. I remember he used to kick at my
having wine in camp and at your having a bottle hidden
away in the bushes.</p>

<p>I had seen that group of you and Joaquin and Stoddard
and laughed at your lifelike impersonation of the Drowsy
Demon.</p>

<p>I passed the first half of last month in New York. Went
there for a dinner and stayed to twelve. Sam Davis and
Homer Davenport were of the party.</p>

<p>Sam was here for a few days&mdash;but maybe you don't know
Sam. He's a brother to Bob, who swears you got your
Dante-like solemnity of countenance by coming into his
office when he was editing a newspaper.</p>

<p>You are not to think I have thrown *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* over. There
are only two or three matters of seriousness between us
and they cannot profitably be discussed in letters, so they
must wait until he and I meet if we ever do. I shall mention
them to no one else and I don't suppose he will to anyone
but me. Apart from these&mdash;well, our correspondence
was disagreeable, so the obvious thing to do was to put an
end to it. To unlike a friend is not an easy thing to do, and<span class="pagenum">117</span>
I've not attempted to do it.</p>

<p>Of course I approve the new lines in the "Wine" and if
Neale or anybody else will have the poem I shall insert
them in their place. That "screaming thing" stays with
one almost as does "the blue-eyed vampire," and is not
only visible, as is she, but audible as well. If you go on
adding lines to the poem I shall not so sharply deplore our
failure to get it into print. As Mark Twain says: "Every
time you draw you fill."</p>

<p>The "Night in Heaven" is fine work in the grand style
and its swing is haunting when one gets it. I get a jolt or
two in the reading, but I dare say you purposely contrived
them and I can't say they hurt. Of course the rhythm recalls
Kipling's "The Last Chanty" (I'm not sure I spell
the word correctly&mdash;if there's a correct way) but that is
nothing. Nobody has the copyright of any possible metre
or rhythm in English prosody. It has been long since anybody
was "first." When are you coming to Washington to
sail in my canoe? Sincerely yours,

<p>I've been in New York again but am slowly recovering. I
saw Neale. He assures me that the magazine will surely
materialize about June, and he wants the poem, "A Wine
of Wizardry," with an introduction by me. I think he
means it; if so that will give it greater publicity than what
you have in mind, even if the mag eventually fail. Magazines
if well advertised usually sell several hundred thousand
of the first issue; the trick is to keep them going. Munsey's
"Scrap Book" disposed of a half-million. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* was to start for a few weeks in California about
now. I hope you will see him. He is not a bad lot when convinced<span class="pagenum">118</span>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Dear George</span>,</p>

<p>Your letter relieves me greatly. I had begun to fear that
you had "gone before." Thank you very much for your
news of our friends. I had already heard from Eva Croffie.
Also from Grizzly.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Thank you for Mr. Eddy's review of "Shapes." But he is
misinformed about poor Flora Shearer. Of course I helped<span class="pagenum">119</span>
her&mdash;who would not help a good friend in adversity? But
she went to Scotland to a brother long ago, and at this time
I do not know if she is living or dead.</p>

<p>But here am I forgetting (momentarily) that awful wiping
out of San Francisco. It "hit" me pretty hard in many
ways&mdash;mostly indirectly, through my friends. I had rather
hoped to have to "put up" for you and your gang, and am
a trifle disappointed to know that you are all right&mdash;except
the chimneys. I'm glad that tidal wave did not come, but
don't you think you'd better have a canoe ready? You
could keep it on your veranda stacked with provisions and
whiskey.</p>

<p>My letter from Ursus (written during the conflagration)
expresses a keen solicitude for the Farallones, as the fire
was working westward.</p>

<p>If this letter is a little disconnected and incoherent know,
O King, that I have just returned from a dinner in Atlantic
City, N. J. I saw Markham there, also Bob Davis, Sam
Moffett, Homer Davenport, Bob Mackay and other San
Franciscans. (Can there be a San Franciscan when there is
no San Francisco? I don't want to go back. Doubtless the
new San Francisco&mdash;while it lasts&mdash;will be a finer town
than the old, but it will not be <i>my</i> San Francisco and I
don't want to see it. It has for many years been, to me, full
of ghosts. Now it is itself a ghost.)</p>

<p>I return the sonnets. Destruction of "Town Talk" has
doubtless saved you from having the one on me turned
down. Dear old fellow, don't take the trouble to defend my
memory when&mdash;or at least until&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem"><span class="i2">"I am fled</span><br />

<p>I'm not letting my enemies' attitude trouble me at all. On<span class="pagenum">120</span>
the contrary, I'm rather sorry for them and their insomnia&mdash;lying
awake o' nights to think out new and needful lies
about me, while I sleep sweetly. O, it is all right, truly.</p>

<p>No, I never had any row (nor much acquaintance) with
Mark Twain&mdash;met him but two or three times. Once with
Stoddard in London. I think pretty well of him, but doubt
if he cared for me and can't, at the moment, think of any
reason why he <i>should</i> have cared for me.</p>

<p>"The Cynic's Dictionary" is a-printing. I shall have to
call it something else, for the publishers tell me there is a
"Cynic's Dictionary" already out. I dare say the author
took more than my title&mdash;the stuff has been a rich mine
for a plagiarist for many a year. They (the publishers)
won't have "The Devil's Dictionary." Here in the East
the Devil is a sacred personage (the Fourth Person of the
Trinity, as an Irishman might say) and his name must not
be taken in vain.</p>

<p>No, "The Testimony of the Suns" has not "palled" on
me. I still read it and still think it one of the world's greatest
poems.</p>

<p>Your poem, "A Dream of Fear" was so good before that
it needed no improvement, though I'm glad to observe that
you have "the passion for perfection." Sure&mdash;you shall
have your word "colossal" applied to a thing of two dimensions,

<p>I have no objection to the publication of that sonnet on<span class="pagenum">121</span>
me. It may give my enemies a transient feeling that is disagreeable,
and if I can do that without taking any trouble
in the matter myself it is worth doing. I think they must
have renewed their activity, to have provoked you so&mdash;got
up a new and fascinating lie, probably. Thank you for putting
your good right leg into action themward.</p>

<p>What a "settlement" you have collected about you at
Carmel! All manner of cranks and curios, to whom I feel
myself drawn by affinity. Still I suppose I shall not go. I
should have to see the new San Francisco&mdash;when it has
foolishly been built&mdash;and I'd rather not. One does not care
to look upon either the mutilated face of one's mashed
friend or an upstart imposter bearing his name. No, <i>my</i>
San Francisco is gone and I'll have no other.</p>

<p>You are wrong about Gorky&mdash;he has none of the "artist"
in him. He is not only a peasant, but an anarchist and an
advocate of assassination&mdash;by others; like most of his
tribe, he doesn't care to take the risk himself. His "career"
in this country has been that of a yellow dog. Hearst's
newspapers and *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* are the only friends that remain to
him of all those that acclaimed him when he landed. And
all the sturdy lying of the former cannot rehabilitate him.
It isn't merely the woman matter. You'd understand if you
were on this side of the country. I was myself a dupe in the
matter. He had expressed high admiration of my books (in
an interview in Russia) and when his Government released
him from prison I cabled him congratulations. O, my!</p>

<p>Yes, I've observed the obviously lying estimates of the
San Franciscan dead; also that there was no earthquake&mdash;just
a fire; also the determination to "beat" the insurance
companies. Insurance is a hog game, and if they (the companies)<span class="pagenum">122</span>
can be beaten out of their dishonest gains by
superior dishonesty I have no objection; but in my judgment
they are neither legally nor morally liable for the half
that is claimed of them. Those of them that took no earthquake
risks don't owe a cent.</p>

<p>Please don't send *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*'s verses to me if you can decently
decline. I should be sorry to find them bad, and my loathing
of the Whitmaniacal "form" is as deep as yours. Perhaps
I should find them good otherwise, but the probability
is so small that I don't want to take the chance.</p>

<p>I've just finished reading the first proofs of "The Cynic's
Word Book," which Doubleday, Page &amp; Co. are to bring
out in October. My dealings with them have been most
pleasant and one of them whom I met the other day at
Atlantic City seems a fine fellow.</p>

<p>I think I told you that S. O. Howes, of Galveston, Texas,
is compiling a book of essays and sich from some of my
stuff that I sent him. I've left the selection entirely to him
and presented him with the profits if there be any. He'll
probably not even find a publisher. He has the work about
half done. By the way, he is an enthusiastic admirer of you.
For that I like him, and for much else.</p>

<p>If your neighbor Carmelites are really "normal" and
respectable I'm sorry for you. They will surely (remaining
cold sober themselves) drive you to drink. Their sort
affects <i>me</i> that way. God bless the crank and the curio!&mdash;what
would life in this desert be without its mullahs and
its dervishes? A matter of merchants and camel drivers&mdash;no
one to laugh with and at.</p>

<p>Did you see Gorky's estimate of us in "Appleton's"?
Having been a few weeks in the land, whose language he
knows not a word of, he knows (by intuition of genius and
a wee-bit help from Gaylord Wilshire and his gang) all
about us, and tells it in generalities of vituperation as applicable
to one country as to another. He's a dandy bomb-thrower,<span class="pagenum">124</span>
but he handles the stink-pot only indifferently
well. He should write (for "The Cosmopolitan") on "The
Treason of God."</p>

<p>Sorry you didn't like my remarks in that fool "symposium."
If I said enough to make it clear that I don't care a
damn for any of the matters touched upon, nor for the fellows
who <i>do</i> care, I satisfied my wish. It was not intended
to be an "argument" at all&mdash;at least not on my part; I
don't argue with babes and sucklings. Hunter is a decentish
fellow, for a dreamer, but the Hillquit person is a humorless
anarchist. When I complimented him on the beauty of his
neck and expressed the hope of putting a nice, new rope
about it he nearly strangled on the brandy that I was putting
down it at the hotel bar. And it wasn't with merriment.
His anarchist sentiments were all cut out.</p>

<p>I'm not familiar with the poetry of William Vaughan
Moody. Can you "put me on"?</p>

<p>I'm sending you an odd thing by Eugene Wood, of Niagara
Falls, where I met him two or three years ago. I'm sure
you will appreciate it. The poor chap died the other day
and might appropriately&mdash;as he doubtless will&mdash;lie in a
neglected grave. You may return the book when you have
read it enough. I'm confident you never heard of it.</p>

<p>Enclosed is your sonnet, with a few suggestions of no importance.
I had not space on it to say that the superfluity
of superlatives noted, is accentuated by the words "west"
and "quest" immediately following, making a lot of
"ests." The verses are pleasing, but if any villain prefer
them to "In Extremis" may he bite himself with a Snake!</p>

<p>If you'll send me that shuddery thing on Fear&mdash;with the
"clangor of ascending chains" line&mdash;and one or two others
that you'd care to have in a magazine, I'll try them on<span class="pagenum">125</span>
Maxwell. I suspect he will fall dead in the reading, or possibly
dislocate the jaw of him with a yawn, but even so you
will not have written in vain.</p>

<p>Have you tried anything on "Munsey"? Bob Davis is the
editor, and we talked you over at dinner (where would you
could have been). I think he values my judgment a little. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I wish I could be blown upon by your Carmel sea-breeze;
the weather here is wicked! I don't even canoe.</p>

<p>You need not blackguard your poem, "A Visitor," though<span class="pagenum">126</span>
I could wish you had not chosen blank verse. That form
seems to me suitable (in serious verse) only to lofty, not
lowly, themes. Anyhow, I always expect something pretty
high when I begin an unknown poem in blank. Moreover, it
is not your best "medium." Your splendid poem, "Music,"
does not wholly commend itself to me for that reason. May
I say that it is a little sing-songy&mdash;the lines monotonously
alike in their caesural pauses and some of their other
features?</p>

<p>By the way, I'd like to see what you could do in more unsimple
meters than the ones that you handle so well. The
wish came to me the other day in reading Lanier's "The
Marshes of Glynn" and some of his other work. Lanier did
not often equal his master, Swinburne, in getting the most
out of the method, but he did well in the poem mentioned.
Maybe you could manage the dangerous thing. It would be
worth doing and is, therefore, worth trying.</p>

<p>Thank you for the Moody book, which I will return. He
pleaseth me greatly and I could already fill pages with
analyses of him for the reasons therefore. But for you to say
that he has <i>you</i> "skinned"&mdash;that is magnanimity. An excellent
thing in poets, I grant you, and a rare one. There is
something about him and his book in the current "Atlantic,"
by May Sinclair, who, I dare say, has never heard of
<i>you</i>. Unlike you, she thinks his dramatic work the best of
what he does. I've not seen that. To be the best it must be
mighty good.</p>

<p>Yes, poor White's poetry is all you say&mdash;and worse, but,
faith! he "had it in him." What struck me was his candid
apotheosis of piracy on the high seas. I'd hate the fellow
who hadn't some sneaking sympathy with that&mdash;as Goethe
confessed to some sympathy with every vice. Nobody'll ever<span class="pagenum">127</span>
hear of White, but (pray observe, ambitious bard!) he isn't
caring. How wise are the dead!</p>

<p>My friend Howes, of Galveston, has, I think, nearly finished
compiling his book of essaylets from my stuff. Neale
has definitely decided to bring out "The Monk and the
Hangman's Daughter." He has the plates of my two luckless
Putnam books, and is figuring on my "complete works,"
to be published by subscription. I doubt if he will undertake
it right away.</p>

<p>No, my dictionary will not sell. I so assured the publishers.</p>

<p>I lunched with Neale the other day&mdash;he comes down here
once a month. His magazine (I think he is to call it "The
Southerner," or something like that) will not get out this
month, as he expected it to. And for an ominous reason:
He had relied largely on Southern writers, and finds that
they can't write! He assures me that it <i>will</i> appear this winter
and asked me not to withdraw your poem and my remarks
on it unless you asked it. So I did not.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>In your character of bookseller carrying a stock of my

<p>Thank you for the Moody books&mdash;which I'll return soon.
"The Masque of Judgment" has some great work in its
final pages&mdash;quite as great as anything in Faust. The passages
that you marked are good too, but some of them
barely miss being entirely satisfying. It would trouble you
to find many such passages in the other book, which is,
moreover, not distinguished for clarity. I found myself
frequently prompted to ask the author: "What the devil
are you driving at?"</p>

<p>Hanging before me is a water-color of a bit of Carmel
Beach, by Chris Jorgensen, for which I blew in fifty dollars

<p>If you desert Carmel I shall destroy my Jorgensen picture,
build a bungalow in the Catskills and cut out California
forever. (Those are the footprints of my damned
canary, who will neither write himself nor let me write.
Just now he is perched on my shoulder, awaiting the command
to sing&mdash;then he will deafen me with a song without
sense. O he's a poet all right.)</p>

<p>I entirely approve your allegiance to Mammon. If I'd had
brains enough to make a decision like that I could now, at
65, have the leisure to make a good book or two before I go
to the waste-dump. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Get yourself a fat bank account&mdash;there's
no such friend as a bank account, and the
greatest book is a check-book; "You may lay to that!" as
one of Stevenson's pirates puts it.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>No, sir, your boss will not bring you East next June; or if
he does you will not come to Washington. How do I know?
I don't know how I know, but concerning all (and they are
many) who were to come from California to see me I have
never once failed in my forecast of their coming or not coming.
Even in the case of *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*, although I wrote to you, and
to her, as if I expected her, I <i>said</i> to one of my friends:<span class="pagenum">131</span>
"She will not come." I don't think it's a gift of divination&mdash;it
just happens, somehow. Yours is not a very good example,
for you have not said you were coming, "sure."</p>

<p>So your colony of high-brows is re-establishing itself at
the old stand&mdash;Piedmont. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* But Piedmont&mdash;it must
be in the heart of Oakland. I could no longer shoot rabbits
in the gulch back of it and sleep under a tree to shoot more
in the morning. Nor could I traverse that long ridge with
various girls. I dare say there's a boulevard running the
length of it,</p>

<p class="poem">"A palace and a prison on each hand."</p>

<p>If I could stop you from reading that volume of old
"Argonauts" I'd do so, but I suppose an injunction would
not "lie." Yes, I was a slovenly writer in those days,
though enough better than my neighbors to have attracted
my own attention. My knowledge of English was imperfect
"a whole lot." Indeed, my intellectual status (whatever
it may be, and God knows it's enough to make me
blush) was of slow growth&mdash;as was my moral. I mean, I
had not literary sincerity.</p>

<p>Yes, I wrote of Swinburne the distasteful words that you
quote. But they were not altogether untrue. He used to set
my teeth on edge&mdash;could <i>not</i> stand still a minute, and kept
you looking for the string that worked his legs and arms.
And he had a weak face that gave you the memory of chinlessness.
But I have long renounced the views that I once
held about his poetry&mdash;held, or thought I held. I don't
remember, though, if it was as lately as '78 that I held
them.</p>

<p>You write of Miss Dawson. Did she survive the 'quake?
And do you know about her? Not a word of her has reached<span class="pagenum">132</span>
me. Notwithstanding your imported nightingale (upon
which I think you should be made to pay a stiff duty) your
Ina Coolbrith poem is so good that I want to keep it if you
have another copy. I find no amendable faults in it. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>The fellow that told you that I was an editor of "The
Cosmopolitan" has an impediment in his veracity. I simply
write for it, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*, and the less of my stuff the editor uses
the better I'm pleased.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>O, you ask about the "Ursus-Aborn-Gorgias-Agrestis-Polyglot"
stuff. It was written by James F. ("Jimmie")
Bowman&mdash;long dead. (See a pretty bad sonnet on page 94,
"Shapes of Clay.") My only part in the matter was to suggest
the papers and discuss them with him over many mugs
of beer.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>By the way, Neale says he gets almost enough inquiries
for my books (from San Francisco) to justify him in republishing
them.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I have your letter of the 13th. The enclosed slip from the
Pacific Monthly (thank you for it) is amusing. Yes, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
is an insufferable pedant, but I don't at all mind his pedantry.
Any critic is welcome to whack me all he likes if he
will append to his remarks (as *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* had the thoughtfulness
to do) my definition of "Critic" from the "Word
Book."</p>

<p>Please don't bother to write me when the spirit does not<span class="pagenum">133</span>
move you thereto. You and I don't need to write to each
other for any other reason than that we want to. As to
coming East, abstain, O, abstain from promises, lest you
resemble all my other friends out there, who promise
always and never come. It would be delightful to see you
here, but I know how those things arrange themselves without
reference to our desires. We do as we must, not as we
will.</p>

<p>I think that uncle of yours must be a mighty fine fellow.
Be good to him and don't kick at his service, even when
you feel the chain. It beats poetry for nothing a year.</p>

<p>Did you get the "Shiloh" article? I sent it to you. I sent
it also to Paul Elder &amp; Co. (New York branch) for their
book of "Western Classics," and hope it will meet their
need. They wanted something, and it seemed to me as
good, with a little revision, as any of my stuff that I control.
Do you think it would be wise to offer them for republication
"In the Midst of Life"? It is now "out of print"
and on my hands.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I'm glad of your commendation of my "Cosmopolitan"
stuff. They don't give me much of a "show"&mdash;the editor
doesn't love me personally as he should, and lets me do
only enough to avert from himself the attention of Mr.
Hearst and that gentleman's interference with the mutual
admiration game as played in the "Cosmopolitan" office.
As I'm rather fond of light work I'm not shrieking.</p>

<p>Your letter, with the yerba buena and the spray of redwood,
came like a breeze from the hills. And the photographs
are most pleasing. I note that Sloot's moustache is
decently white at last, as becomes a fellow of his years. I
dare say his hair is white too, but I can't see under his hat.
And I think he never removes it. That backyard of yours is
a wonder, but I sadly miss the appropriate ash-heaps, tin
cans, old packing-boxes, and so forth. And that palm in
front of the house&mdash;gracious, how she's grown! Well, it has
been more than a day growing, and I've not watched it
attentively.</p>

<p>I hope you'll have a good time in Yosemite, but Sloots is
an idiot not to go with you&mdash;nineteen days is as long as
anybody would want to stay there.</p>

<p>I saw a little of Phyllis Partington in New York. She told
me much of you and seems to be fond of you. That is very
intelligent of her, don't you think?</p>

<p>So *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* showed you his article on me. He showed it to
me also, and some of it amused me mightily, though I
didn't tell him so. That picture of me as a grouchy and disappointed
old man occupying the entire cave of Adullam is<span class="pagenum">135</span>
particularly humorous, and so poetic that I would not for
the world "cut it out." *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* seems incapable (like a good
many others) of estimating success in other terms than
those of popularity. He gives a rather better clew to his own
character than to mine. The old man is fairly well pleased
with the way that he has played the game, and with his
share of the stakes, thank'ee.</p>

<p>I note with satisfaction <i>your</i> satisfaction with my article
on you and your poem. I'll correct the quotation about the
"timid sapphires"&mdash;don't know how I happened to leave
out the best part of it. But I left out the line about "harlot's
blood" because I didn't (and don't) think a magazine
would "stand for it" if I called the editor's attention to it.
You don't know what magazines are if you haven't tested
them. However, I'll try it on Chamberlain if you like. And
I'll put in "twilight of the year" too.</p>

<p>It's pleasing to know that you've "cut out" your clerical
work if you can live without it. Now for some great poetry!
Carmel has a fascination for me too&mdash;because of your letters.
If I did not fear illness&mdash;a return of my old complaint&mdash;I'd
set out for it at once. I've nothing to do that would
prevent&mdash;about two day's work a month. But I'd never
set foot in San Francisco. Of all the Sodoms and Gomorrahs
in our modern world it is the worst. There are not ten
righteous (and courageous) men there. It needs another
quake, another whiff of fire, and&mdash;more than all else&mdash;a
steady tradewind of grapeshot. When *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* gets done
blackguarding New York (as it deserves) and has shaken
the dung of San Francisco from his feet I'm going to "sick
him onto" that moral penal colony of the world. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I've just finished reading proofs of my stuff about you
and your poem. Chamberlain, as I apprised you, has it
slated for September. But for that month also he has slated
a longish spook story of mine, besides my regular stuff.
Not seeing how he can run it all in one issue, I have asked
him to run your poem (with my remarks) and hold the
spook yarn till some other time. I <i>hope</i> he'll do so, but if he
doesn't, don't think it my fault. An editor never does as
one wants him to. I inserted in my article another quotation
or two, and restored some lines that I had cut out of
the quotations to save space.</p>

<p>I guess several of your good letters are unanswered, as
are many others of other correspondents. I've been gadding
a good deal lately&mdash;to New York principally. When I want
a royal good time I go to New York; and I get it.</p>

<p>As to Miller being "about the same age" as I, why, no.
The rascal is long past seventy, although nine or ten years
ago he wrote from Alaska that he was "in the middle
fifties." I've known him for nearly thirty years and he
can't fool me with his youthful airs and tales. May he live<span class="pagenum">137</span>
long and repent.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the trouble to send Conan Doyle's
opinion of me. No, it doesn't turn my head; I can show you
dozens of "appreciations" from greater and more famous
men. I return it to you corrected&mdash;as he really wrote it.
Here it is:</p>

<p>"Praise from Sir Hugo is praise indeed." In "Through
the Magic Door," an exceedingly able article on short
stories that have interested him, Conan Doyle pays the following
well-deserved tribute to Ambrose Bierce, whose
wonderful short stories have so often been praised in these
columns: "Talking of weird American stories, have you
ever read any of the works of Ambrose Bierce? I have one
of his books before me, 'In the Midst of Life.' This man
(has) had a flavor quite his own, and (is)<a name="fnanchor_9" id="fnanchor_9"></a><a href="#footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> was a great
artist. It is not cheerful reading, but it leaves its mark upon
you, and that is the proof of good work."</p>

<p>Thank you also for the Jacobs story, which I will read.
As a <i>humorist</i> he is no great thing.</p>

<p>I've not read your Bohemian play to a finish yet, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*.
By the way, I've always wondered why they did not "put
on" Comus. Properly done it would be great woodland
stuff. Read it with a view to that and see if I'm not right.
And then persuade them to "stage it" next year.</p>

<p>I'm being awfully pressed to return to California. No San
Francisco for me, but Carmel sounds good. For about how
much could I get ground and build a bungalow&mdash;for one?
That's a pretty indefinite question; but then the will to go
is a little hazy at present. It consists, as yet, only of the
element of desire. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>The "Cosmopolitan," with your poem, has not come to<span class="pagenum">138</span>
hand but is nearly due&mdash;I'm a little impatient&mdash;eager to
see the particular kind of outrage Chamberlain's artist has
wrought upon it. He (C.) asked for your address the other
day; so he will doubtless send you a check.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Now please go to work at "Lilith"; it's bound to be great
stuff, for you'll have to imagine it all. I'm sorry that anybody
ever invented Lilith; it makes her too much of an historical
character.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">My dear George</span>,</p>

<p>I'm awfully glad that you don't mind Chamberlain's yellow
nonsense in coupling Ella's name with yours. But
when you read her natural opinion of your work you'll
acquit her of complicity in the indignity. I'm sending a few
things from Hearst's newspapers&mdash;written by the slangers,
dialecters and platitudinarians of the staff, and by some of
the swine among the readers.</p>

<p>Note the deliberate and repeated lying of Brisbane in
quoting me as saying the "Wine" is "the greatest poem
ever written in America." Note his dishonesty in confessing
that he has commendatory letters, yet not publishing a
single one of them. But the end is not yet&mdash;my inning is to
come, in the magazine. Chamberlain (who professes an enthusiastic
admiration of the poem) promises me a free hand
in replying to these ignorant asses. If he does not give it to
me I quit. I've writ a paragraph or two for the November<span class="pagenum">139</span>
number (too late now for the October) by way of warning
them what they'll get when December comes. So you see
you must patiently endure the befouling till then.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Did you notice in the last line of the "Wine" that I restored
the word "smile" from your earlier draft of the
verses? In one of your later (I don't remember if in the last)
you had it "sigh." That was wrong; "smile" seems to me
infinitely better as a definition of the poet's attitude toward
his dreams. So, considering that I had a choice, I chose it.
Hope you approve.</p>

<p>I am serious in wishing a place in Carmel as a port of
refuge from the storms of age. I don't know that I shall
ever live there, but should like to feel that I can if I want
to. Next summer I hope to go out there and spy out the
land, and if I then "have the price" (without sacrificing
any of my favorite stocks) I shall buy. I don't care for the
grub question&mdash;should like to try the simple life, for I
have already two gouty finger points as a result of the other
kind of life. (Of course if they all get that way I shan't
mind, for I love uniformity.) Probably if I attempted to
live in Carmel I should have asthma again, from which I
have long been free.</p>

<p>Whether you "prosper" or not I'm glad you write instead
of teaching. I have done a bit of teaching myself, but as the
tuition was gratuitous I could pick my pupils; so it was a
labor of love. I'm pretty well satisfied with the results.</p>

<p>No, I'm not "toiling" much now. I've written all I care<span class="pagenum">140</span>
to, and having a pretty easy berth (writing for The Cosmopolitan
only, and having no connection with Mr.
Hearst's newspapers) am content.</p>

<p>I have observed your story in Success, but as I never never
(sic) read serials shall await its publication in covers before
making a meal of it.</p>

<p>You seem to be living at the old place in Vallejo Street, so
I judge that it was spared by the fire. I had some pretty
good times in that house, not only with you and Mrs. Morrow
(to whom my love, please) but with the dear Hogan
girls. Poor Flodie! she is nearly a sole survivor now. I
wonder if she ever thinks of us.</p>

<p>I hear from California frequently through a little group of
interesting folk who foregather at Carmel&mdash;whither I shall
perhaps stray some day and there leave my bones. Meantime,
I am fairly happy here.</p>

<p>I wish you would add yourself to the Carmel crowd. You
would be a congenial member of the gang and would find
them worth while. You must know George Sterling: he is
the high panjandrum and a gorgeously good fellow. Go get
thee a bungalow at Carmel, which is indubitably the
charmingest place in the State. As to San Francisco, with
its labor-union government, its thieves and other impossibilities,
I could not be drawn into it by a team of behemoths.
But California&mdash;ah, I dare not permit myself to
remember it. Yet this Eastern country is not without
charm. And my health is good here, as it never was there.
Nothing ails me but age, which brings its own cure.</p>

<p>God keep thee!&mdash;go and live at Carmel.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">James D. Blake, Esq.</span>,<br /><span class="pagenum">141</span>
<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:</p>

<p>It is a matter of no great importance to me, but the republication
of the foolish books that you mention would
not be agreeable to me. They have no kind of merit or
interest. One of them, "The Fiend's Delight," was published
against my protest; the utmost concession that the
compiler and publisher (the late John Camden Hatten,
London) would make was to let me edit his collection of my
stuff and write a preface. You would pretty surely lose
money on any of them.</p>

<p>If you care to republish anything of mine you would, I
think, do better with "Black Beetles in Amber," or
"Shapes of Clay." The former sold well, and the latter
would, I think, have done equally well if the earthquake-and-fire
had not destroyed it, including the plates. Nearly
all of both books were sold in San Francisco, and the sold,
as well as the unsold, copies&mdash;I mean the unsold copies of
the latter&mdash;perished in the fire. There is much inquiry for
them (mainly from those who lost them) and I am told
that they bring fancy prices. You probably know about
that better than I.</p>

<p>I should be glad to entertain proposals from you for their
republication&mdash;in San Francisco&mdash;and should not be exacting
as to royalties, and so forth.</p>

<p>But the other books are "youthful indiscretions" and are
"better dead." Sincerely yours,
<span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Dear George</span>,</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Please send me a copy of the new edition of "The Testimony."
I borrowed one of the first edition to give away,
and want to replace it. Did you add the "Wine" to it? I'd<span class="pagenum">142</span>
not leave off the indefinite article from the title of that; it
seems to dignify the tipple by hinting that it was no ordinary
tope. It may have been witch-fermented.</p>

<p>I don't "dislike" the line: "So terribly that brilliance
shall enhance"; it seems merely less admirable than the
others. Why didn't I tell you so? I could not tell you <i>all</i> I
thought of the poem&mdash;for another example, how I loved
the lines:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span class="o1">"Where Dawn upon a pansy's breast hath laid</span><br />
A single tear, and <i>whence the wind hath flown<br />
And left a silence</i>."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I'm returning you, under another cover (as the ceremonial
slangers say) some letters that have come to me and
that I have answered. I have a lot more, most of them
abusive, I guess, that I'll dig out later. But the most pleasing
ones I can't send, for I sent them to Brisbane on his
promise to publish them, which the liar did not, nor has he
had the decency to return them. I'm hardly sorry, for it
gave me good reason to call him a peasant and a beast of
the field. I'm always grateful for the chance to prod somebody.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I detest the "limited edition" and "autograph copies"
plan of publication, but for the sake of Howes, who has
done a tremendous lot of good work on my book, have assented
to Blake's proposal in all things and hope to be able
to laugh at this brilliant example of the "irony of fate."
I've refused to profit in any way by the book. I want
Howes to "break even" for his labor.</p>

<p>By the way, Pollard and I had a good time in Galveston,
and on the way I took in some of my old battlefields. At
Galveston they nearly killed me with hospitality&mdash;so<span class="pagenum">143</span>
nearly that Pollard fled. I returned via Key West and
Florida.</p>

<p>You'll probably see Howes next Summer&mdash;I've persuaded
him to go West and renounce the bookworm habit for some
other folly. Be good to him; he is a capital fellow in his odd,
amusing way.</p>

<p>I didn't know there was an American edition of "The
Fiends' Delight." Who published it and when?</p>

<p>Congratulations on acceptance of "Tasso and Leonora."
But I wouldn't do much in blank verse if I were you. It
betrays you (somehow) into mere straightaway expression,
and seems to repress in you the glorious abundance of
imagery and metaphor that enriches your rhyme-work.
This is not a criticism, particularly, of "Tasso," which is
good enough for anybody, but&mdash;well, it's just <i>so</i>.</p>

<p>I'm not doing much. My stuff in the Cosmo. comes last,
and when advertisements crowd some of it is left off. Most
of it gets in later (for of course I don't replace it with more
work) but it is sadly antiquated. My checks, though, are
always up to date. Sincerely<a name="fnanchor_10" id="fnanchor_10"></a><a href="#footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> yours, <span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

<p>I have just come upon a letter of yours that I got at Galveston
and (I fear) did not acknowledge. But I've written
you since, so I fancy all is well.</p>

<p>You mention that sonnet that Chamberlain asked for.
You should not have let him have it&mdash;it was, as you say,
the kind of stuff that magazines like. Nay, it was even
better. But I wish you'd sent it elsewhere. You owed it to
me not to let the Cosmopolitan's readers see anything of<span class="pagenum">144</span>
yours (for awhile, at least) that was less than <i>great</i>. Something
as great as the sonnet that you sent to McClure's
was what the circumstances called for.</p>

<p>"And strict concern of relativity"&mdash;O bother! that's not
poetry. It's the slang of philosophy.</p>

<p>I am still awaiting my copy of the new "Testimony."
That's why I'm scolding.</p>

<p>I'm an age acknowledging your letter; but then you'd
have been an age writing it if you had not done it for
"Sloots." And the other day I had one from him, written
in his own improper person.</p>

<p>I think it abominable that he and Carlt have to work so
hard&mdash;at <i>their</i> age&mdash;and I quite agree with George Sterling
that Carlt ought to go to Carmel and grow potatoes.
I'd like to do that myself, but for the fact that so many
objectionable persons frequent the place: *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*, *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and
the like. I'm hoping, however, that the ocean will swallow
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and be unable to throw him up.</p>

<p>I trust you'll let Sloots "retire" at seventy, which is
really quite well along in life toward the years of discretion
and the age of consent. But when he is retired I know that
he will bury himself in the redwoods and never look upon
the face of man again. That, too, I should rather like to do
myself&mdash;for a few months.</p>

<p>I've laid out a lot of work for myself this season, and
doubt if I shall get to California, as I had hoped. So I shall
never, never see you. But you might send me a photograph.</p>

<p>God be with you. <span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear George</span>,</p>

<p>I am sorry to learn that you have not been able to break
your commercial chains, since you wish to, though I don't
at all know that they are bad for you. I've railed at mine
all my life, but don't remember that I ever made any good
use of leisure when I had it&mdash;unless the mere "having a
good time" is such. I remember once writing that one's
career, or usefulness, was about ended when one thought
less about how best to do his work than about the hardship
of having to do it. I might have said the hardship of having
so little leisure to do it. As I grow older I see more and more
clearly the advantages of disadvantage, the splendid urge
of adverse conditions, the uplifting effect of repression.
And I'm ashamed to note how little <i>I</i> profited by them. I
wasn't the right kind, that is all; but I indulge the hope
that <i>you</i> are.</p>

<p>No I don't think it of any use, your trying to keep *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
and me friends. But don't let that interfere with your
regard for him if you have it. We are not required to share
one another's feelings in such matters. I should not expect
you to like my friends nor hate my enemies if they seemed
to you different from what they seem to me; nor would I
necessarily follow <i>your</i> lead. For example, I loathe your
friend *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* and expect his safe return because the ocean
will refuse to swallow him.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I congratulate you on the Gilder acceptance of your sonnet,
and on publication of the "Tasso to Leonora." I don't
think it your best work by much&mdash;don't think any of your
blank verse as good as most of your rhyme&mdash;but it's not a<span class="pagenum">146</span>
thing to need apology.</p>

<p>Certainly, I shall be pleased to see Hopper. Give me his
address, and when I go to New York&mdash;this month or the
next&mdash;I'll look him up. I think well of Hopper and trust
that he will not turn out to be an 'ist of some kind, as most
writers and artists do. That is because they are good feelers
and poor thinkers. It is the emotional element in them, not
the logical, that makes them writers and artists. They have,
as a rule, sensibility and no sense. Except the <i>big</i> fellows.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Neale has in hand already three volumes of the "Collected
Works," and will have two more in about a month;
and all (I hope) this year. I'm revising all the stuff and cutting
it about a good deal, taking from one book stuff for
another, and so forth. If Neale gets enough subscriptions
he will put out all the ten volumes next year; if not I shall
probably not be "here" to see the final one issued.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Glad you think better of my part in the Hunter-Hillquit
"symposium." <i>I</i> think I did very well considering, first,
that I didn't care a damn about the matter; second, that I
knew nothing of the men I was to meet, nor what we were
to talk about, whereas they came cocked and primed for
the fray; and, third, that the whole scheme was to make a
Socialist holiday at my expense. Of all 'ists the Socialist is
perhaps the damnedest fool for (in this country) he is
merely the cat that pulls chestnuts from the fire for the
Anarchist. His part of the business is to talk away the
country's attention while the Anarchist places the bomb.
In some countries Socialism is clean, but not in this. And
everywhere the Socialist is a dreamer and futilitarian.</p>

<p>But I guess I'll call a halt on this letter, the product of an<span class="pagenum">147</span>

<p>Your note inquiring about "Ashes of the Beacon" interests
me. You mention it as a "pamphlet." I have no knowledge
of its having appeared otherwise than as an article
in the Sunday edition of the "N. Y. American"&mdash;I do not
recall the date. If it has been published as a pamphlet, or
in any other form, separately&mdash;that is by itself&mdash;I should
like "awfully" to know by whom, if <i>you</i> know.</p>

<p>I should be pleased to send it to you&mdash;in the "American"&mdash;if
I had a copy of the issue containing it, but I have not. It
will be included in Vol. I of my "Collected Works," to be
published by the Neale Publishing Company, N. Y. That
volume will be published probably early next year.</p>

<p>But the work is to be in ten or twelve costly volumes, and
sold by subscription only. That buries it fathoms deep so
far as the public is concerned.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Dear George</span>,</p>

<p>I am amused by your attitude toward the spaced sonnet,
and by the docility of Gilder. If I had been your editor I
guess you'd have got back your sonnets. I never liked the
space. If the work naturally divides itself into two parts, as
it should, the space is needless; if not, it is worse than that.
The space was the invention of printers of a comparatively
recent period, neither Petrarch nor Dante (as Gilder points<span class="pagenum">148</span>
out) knew of it. Every magazine has its own <i>system</i> of
printing, and Gilder's good-natured compliance with your
wish, or rather demand, shows him to be a better fellow,
though not a better poet, than I have thought him to be.
As a victory of author over editor, the incident pleases.</p>

<p>I've not yet been in New York, but expect to go soon. I
shall be glad to meet Hopper if he is there.</p>

<p>Thank you for the article from "Town Talk." It suggests
this question: How many times, and covering a period of
how many years, must one's unexplainable obscurity be
pointed out to constitute fame? Not knowing, I am almost
disposed to consider myself the most famous of authors. I
have pretty nearly ceased to be "discovered," but my
notoriety as an obscurian may be said to be worldwide and
apparently everlasting.</p>

<p>The trouble, I fancy, is with our vocabulary&mdash;the lack of
a word meaning something intermediate between "popular"
and "obscure"&mdash;and the ignorance of writers as to
the reading of readers. I seldom meet a person of education
who is not acquainted with some of my work; my clipping
bureau's bills were so heavy that I had to discontinue my
patronage, and Blake tells me that he sells my books at one
hundred dollars a set. Rather amusing all this to one so
widely unknown.</p>

<p>I sometimes wonder what you think of Scheff's new book.
Does it perform the promise of the others? In the dedicatory
poem it seems to me that it does, and in some others.
As a good Socialist you are bound to like <i>that</i> poem because
of its political-economic-views. I like it despite them.</p>

<p class="poem">
<span class="o1">"The dome of the Capitol roars</span><br />
With the shouts of the Caesars of crime"</p>

<p>is great poetry, but it is not true. I am rather familiar with<span class="pagenum">149</span>
what goes on in the Capitol&mdash;not through the muck-rakers,
who pass a few days here "investigating," and then
look into their pockets and write, but through years of personal
observation and personal acquaintance with the men
observed. There are no Caesars of crime, but about a dozen
rascals, all told, mostly very small fellows; I can name them
all. They are without power or influence enough to count
in the scheme of legislation. The really dangerous and mischievous
chaps are the demagogues, friends of the pee-pul.
And they do all the "shouting." Compared with the Congress
of our forefathers, the Congress of to-day is as a flock
of angels to an executive body of the Western Federation
of Miners.</p>

<p>When I showed the "dome" to *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* (who had been
reading his own magazine) the tears came into his voice,
and I guess his eyes, as he lamented the decay of civic
virtue, "the treason of the Senate," and the rest of it. He
was so affected that I hastened to brace him up with whiskey.
He, too, was "squirming" about "other persons'
troubles," and with about as good reason as you.</p>

<p>I think "the present system" is not "frightful." It is all
right&mdash;a natural outgrowth of human needs, limitations
and capacities, instinct with possibilities of growth in goodness,
elastic, and progressively better. Why don't you
study humanity as you do the suns&mdash;not from the viewpoint
of time, but from that of eternity. The middle ages
were yesterday, Rome and Greece the day before. The individual
man is nothing, as a single star is nothing. If this
earth were to take fire you would smile to think how little
it mattered in the scheme of the universe; all the wailing of
the egoist mob would not affect you. Then why do you
squirm at the minute catastrophe of a few thousands or<span class="pagenum">150</span>
millions of pismires crushed under the wheels of evolution.
Must the new heavens and the new earth of prophecy and
science come in <i>your</i> little instant of life in order that you
may not go howling and damning with Jack London up
and down the earth that we happen to have? Nay, nay,
read history to get the long, large view&mdash;to learn to think
in centuries and cycles. Keep your eyes off your neighbors
and fix them on the nations. What poetry we shall have
when you get, and give us, The Testimony of the Races!</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I peg away at compilation and revision. I'm cutting-about
my stuff a good deal&mdash;changing things from one
book to another, adding, subtracting and dividing. Five
volumes are ready, and Neale is engaged in a "prospectus"
which he says will make me blush. I'll send it to you when
he has it ready.</p>

<p>Gertrude Atherton is sending me picture-postals of
Berchtesgaden and other scenes of "The Monk and the
Hangman's Daughter." She found all the places "exactly
as described"&mdash;the lakes, mountains, St. Bartolomae, the
cliff-meadow where the edelweiss grows, and so forth. The
photographs are naturally very interesting to me.</p>

<p>I'm going to read Hopper's book, and if it doesn't show
him to be a *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* or a *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I'll call on him. If it does I
won't. I'm getting pretty particular in my old age; the
muck-rakers, blood-boilers and little brothers-of-the-bad
are not congenial.</p>

<p>By the way, why do you speak of my "caning" you. I did
not suppose that <i>you</i> had joined the innumerable caravan
of those who find something sarcastic or malicious in my
good natured raillery in careless controversy. If I choose to
smile in ink at your inconsistency in weeping for the woes
of individual "others"&mdash;meaning other <i>humans</i>&mdash;while
you, of course, don't give a damn for the thousands of lives
that you crush out every time you set down your foot, or
eat a berry, why shouldn't <i>I</i> do so? One can't always remember
to stick to trifles, even in writing a letter. Put on
your skin, old man, I may want to poke about with my
finger again.</p>

<p>I'm still working at my book. Seven volumes are completed
and I've read the proofs of Vol. I.</p>

<p>Your account of the "movement" to free the oppressed
and downtrodden river from the tyranny of the sand-bar
tickled me in my lonesome rib. Surely no colony of reformers
ever engaged in a more characteristic crusade against
the Established Order and Intolerable Conditions. I can
almost hear you patting yourselves on your aching backs
as you contemplated your encouraging success in beating
Nature and promoting the Cause. I believe that if I'd been
there my cold heart and indurated mind would have
caught the contagion of the Great Reform. Anyhow, I
should have appreciated the sunset which (characteristically)
intervened in the interest of Things as They Are. I
feel sure that whenever you Socialers shall have found a
way to make the earth stop "turning over and over like a
man in bed" (as Joaquin might say) you will accomplish
all the reforms that you have at heart. All that you need is
plenty of time&mdash;a few kalpas, more or less, of uninterrupted
daylight. Meantime I await your new book with impatience
and expectation.</p>

<p>I have photographs of my brother's shack in the redwoods
and feel strongly drawn in that direction&mdash;since, as
you fully infer, Carmel is barred. Probably, though, I shall
continue in the complicated life of cities while I last.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Dear George</span>,</p>

<p>I've been reading your book&mdash;re-reading most of it&mdash;"every
little while." I don't know that it is better than<span class="pagenum">153</span>
your first, but to say that it is as good is praise enough.
You know what I like most in it, but there are some things
that you <i>don't</i> know I like. For an example, "Night in
Heaven." It Kipples a bit, but it is great. But I'm not
going to bore you with a catalogue of titles. The book is <i>all</i>
good. No, not (in my judgment) all, for it contains lines
and words that I found objectionable in the manuscript,
and time has not reconciled me to them. Your retention of
them, shows, however, that you agree with me in thinking
that you have passed your 'prentice period and need no
further criticism. So I welcome them.</p>

<p>I take it that the cover design is Scheff's&mdash;perhaps because
it is so good, for the little cuss is clever that way.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I rather like your defence of Jack London&mdash;not that I
think it valid, but because I like loyalty to a friend whom
one does not believe to be bad. (The "thick-and-thin" loyalty
never commended itself to me; it is too dog-like.) I
fail, however, to catch the note of penitence in London's
narratives of his underlife, and my charge of literary stealing
was not based on his primeval man book, "Before
Adam."</p>

<p>As to *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*, as he is not more than a long-range or short-acquaintance
friend of yours, I'll say that I would not
believe him under oath on his deathbed. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The truth
is, none of these howlers knows the difference between a
million and a thousand nor between truth and falsehood. I
could give you instances of their lying about matters here
at the capital that would make even your hair stand on
end. It is not only that they are all liars&mdash;they are mere
children; they don't know anything and don't care to, nor,<span class="pagenum">154</span>
for prosperity in their specialties, need to. Veracity would
be a disqualification; if they confined themselves to facts
they would not get a hearing. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* is the nastiest futilitarian
of the gang.</p>

<p>It is not the purpose of these gentlemen that I find so
very objectionable, but the foul means that they employ to
accomplish it. I would be a good deal of a Socialist myself
if they had not made the word (and the thing) stink.</p>

<p>Don't imagine that I'll not "enter Carmel" if I come out
there. I'll visit you till you're sick of me. But I'd not <i>live</i>
there and be "identified" with it, as the newspapers would
say. I'm warned by Hawthorne and Brook Farm.</p>

<p>I'm still working&mdash;a little more leisurely&mdash;on my books.
But I begin to feel the call of New York on the tympani of
my blood globules. I must go there occasionally, or I should
die of intellectual torpor. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* "O Lord how long?"&mdash;this
letter. O well, you need not give it the slightest attention;
there's nothing, I think, that requires a reply, nor merits
one.</p>

<p>Did you see Markham's review of the "Wine" in "The
N. Y. American"? Pretty fair, but&mdash;if a metrical composition
full of poetry is not a poem what is it? And I wonder
what he calls Kubla Khan, which has a beginning but
neither middle nor end. And how about The Faerie Queene
for absence of "unity"? Guess I'll ask him.</p>

<p>Isn't it funny what happens to critics who would mark
out meters and bounds for the Muse&mdash;denying the name
"poem," for example, to a work because it is not like some<span class="pagenum">155</span>

<p>I return the poems with a few random comments and suggestions.</p>

<p>I'm a little alarmed lest you take too seriously my preference
of your rhyme to your blank&mdash;especially when I
recall your "Music" and "The Spirit of Beauty." Perhaps
I should have said only that you are not so <i>likely</i> to write
well in blank. (I think always of "Tasso to Leonora,"
which I cannot learn to like.) Doubtless I have too great
fondness for <i>great</i> lines&mdash;<i>your</i> great lines&mdash;and they occur
less frequently in your blank verse than in your rhyme&mdash;most
frequently in your quatrains, those of sonnets included.
Don't swear off blank&mdash;except as you do drink&mdash;but
study it more. It's "an hellish thing."</p>

<p>It looks as if I <i>might</i> go to California sooner than I had
intended. My health has been wretched all summer. I need
a sea voyage&mdash;one <i>via</i> Panama would be just the thing.
So if the cool weather of autumn do not restore me I shall
not await spring here. But I'm already somewhat better.
If I had been at sea I should have escaped the Cook-Peary
controversy. We talk nothing but arctic matters here&mdash;I
enclose my contribution to its horrors.</p>

<p>I'm getting many a good lambasting for my book of essays.
Also a sop of honey now and then. It's all the same to me;<span class="pagenum">156</span>
I don't worry about what my contemporaries think of me.
I made 'em think of <i>you</i>&mdash;that's glory enough for one.
And the squirrels in the public parks think me the finest
fellow in the world. They know what I have in every
pocket. Critics don't know that&mdash;nor nearly so much.</p>

<p>Advice to a young author: Cultivate the good opinion of
squirrels.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Dear George</span>,</p>

<p>European criticism of your <i>bête noir</i>, old Leopold, is entitled
to attention; American (of him or any other king) is
not. It looks as if the wretch may be guilty of indifference.</p>

<p>In condemning as "revolutionary" the two-rhyme sestet,
I think I could not have been altogether solemn, for (1)
I'm something of a revolutionist myself regarding the sonnet,
having frequently expressed the view that its accepted
forms&mdash;even the number of lines&mdash;were purely arbitrary;
(2) I find I've written several two-rhyme sestets myself,
and (3), like yours, my ear has difficulty in catching the
rhyme effect in a-b-c, a-b-c. The rhyme is delayed till the
end of the fourth line&mdash;as it is in the quatrain (not of the
sonnet) with unrhyming first and third lines&mdash;a form of
which I think all my multitude of verse supplies no example.
I confess, though, that I did not know that Petrarch
had made so frequent use of the 2-rhyme sestet.</p>

<p>I learn a little all the time; some of my old notions of
poetry seem to me now erroneous, even absurd. So I <i>may</i>
have been at one time a stickler for the "regular" three-rhymer.
Even now it pleases my ear well enow if the three
are not so arranged as to elude it. I'm sorry if I misled you.
You'd better 'fess up to your young friend, as I do to you&mdash;if<span class="pagenum">157</span>
I really was serious.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Of course I should be glad to see Dick, but don't expect
to. They never come, and it has long been my habit to ignore
every "declaration of intention."</p>

<p>I'm greatly pleased to know that you too like those lines
of Markham that you quote from the "Wharf of Dreams."
I've repeatedly told him that that sonnet was his greatest
work, and those were its greatest lines. By the way, my
young poet, Loveman, sends me a letter from Markham,
asking for a poem or two for a book, "The Younger Choir,"
that he (M.) is editing. Loveman will be delighted by your
good opinion of "Pierrot"&mdash;which still another magazine
has returned to me. Guess I'll have to give it up.</p>

<p>I'm sending you a booklet on loose locutions. It is vilely
gotten up&mdash;had to be so to sell for twenty-five cents, the
price that I favored. I just noted down these things as I
found them in my reading, or remembered them, until I had
four hundred. Then I took about fifty from other books, and
boiled down the needful damnation. Maybe I have done too
much boiling down&mdash;making the stuff "thick and slab."
If there is another edition I shall do a little bettering.</p>

<p>I should like some of those mussels, and, please God, shall
help you cull them next summer. But the abalone&mdash;as a
Christian comestible he is a stranger to me and the tooth
o' me.</p>

<p>I think you have had some correspondence with my
friend Howes of Galveston. Well, here he is "in his habit
as he lives." Of the two figures in the picture Howes is the

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Dear George</span>,</p>

<p>Here are your fine verses&mdash;I have been too busy to write<span class="pagenum">158</span>
to you before. In truth, I've worked harder now for more
than a year than I ever shall again&mdash;and the work will
bring me nor gain nor glory. Well, I shall take a rest pretty
soon, partly in California. I thank you for the picture card.
I have succumbed to the post-card fashion myself.</p>

<p>As to some points in your letter.</p>

<p>I've no recollection of advising young authors to "leave
all heart and sentiment out of their work." If I did the context
would probably show that it was because their time
might better be given to perfect themselves in form,
against the day when their hearts would be less wild and
their sentiments truer. You know it has always been my
belief that one cannot be trusted to feel until one has
learned to think&mdash;and few youngsters have learned to do
that. Was it not Dr. Holmes who advised a young writer
to cut out every passage that he thought particularly good?
He'd be sure to think the beautiful and sentimental passages
the best, would he not? *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>If you mean to write really "vituperative" sonnets (why
sonnets?) let me tell you <i>one</i> secret of success&mdash;name your
victim and his offense. To do otherwise is to fire blank
cartridges&mdash;to waste your words in air&mdash;to club a vacuum.
At least your satire must be so personally applicable
that there can be no mistake as to the victim's identity.
Otherwise he is no victim&mdash;just a spectator like all others.
And that brings us to Watson. His caddishness consisted,
not in satirizing a woman, which is legitimate, but, first, in
doing so without sufficient reason, and, second, in saying
orally (on the safe side of the Atlantic) what he apparently
did not dare say in the verses. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I'm enclosing something that will tickle you I hope&mdash;"The<span class="pagenum">159</span>
Ballade of the Goodly Fere." The author's<a name="fnanchor_12" id="fnanchor_12"></a><a href="#footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> father,
who is something in the Mint in Philadelphia, sent me several
of his son's poems that were not good; but at last came
this&mdash;in manuscript, like the others. Before I could do
anything with it&mdash;meanwhile wearing out the paper and
the patience of my friends by reading it at them&mdash;the old
man asked it back rather peremptorily. I reluctantly sent
it, with a letter of high praise. The author had "placed" it
in London, where it has made a heap of talk.</p>

<p>It has plenty of faults besides its monotonous rhyme
scheme; but tell me what you think of it.</p>

May or June. Sincerely yours, <span class="smcap flright">Ambrose Bierce.</span></p>

<p>My plan is to leave here before April first, pass a few days
in New York and then sail for Colon. If I find the canal
work on the Isthmus interesting I may skip a steamer from
Panama to see it. I've no notion how long it will take to
reach San Francisco, and know nothing of the steamers
and their schedules on the Pacific side.</p>

<p>I shall of course want to see Grizzly first&mdash;that is to say,
he will naturally expect me to. But if you can pull him
down to Carmel about the time of my arrival (I shall write
you the date of my sailing from New York) I would gladly
come there. Carlt, whom I can see at once on arriving, can
tell me where he (Grizzly) is. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I don't think you rightly value "The Goodly Fere." Of
course no ballad written to-day can be entirely good, for it
must be an imitation; it is now an unnatural form, whereas
it was once a natural one. We are no longer a primitive<span class="pagenum">160</span>
people, and a primitive people's forms and methods are not
ours. Nevertheless, this seems to me an admirable ballad,
as it is given a modern to write ballads. And I think you
overlook the best line:</p>

<p class="poem">"The hounds of the crimson sky gave tongue."</p>

<p>The poem is complete as I sent it, and I think it stops
right where and as it should&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">
<span class="o1">"I ha' seen him eat o' the honey comb</span><br />
Sin' they nailed him to the tree."</p>

<p>The current "Literary Digest" has some queer things
about (and by) Pound, and "Current Literature" reprints
the "Fere" with all the wrinkles ironed out of it&mdash;making
a "capon priest" of it.</p>

<p>Fo' de Lawd's sake! don't apologise for not subscribing
for my "Works." If you did subscribe I should suspect that
you were "no friend o' mine"&mdash;it would remove you from

can not think I care who buys or does not buy my books.
The man who expects anything more than lip-service from
his friends is a very young man. There are, for example, a
half-dozen Californians (all loud admirers of Ambrose
Bierce) editing magazines and newspapers here in the
East. Every man Jack of them has turned me down. They
will do everything for me but enable me to live. Friends

the Universe! Not a Homeric hero in the imminence of a personal
encounter ever did so fine bragging. I hope you will
let it into your next book, if only to show that the "inspired"
scribes of the Old Testament are not immatchable
by modern genius. You know the Jews regard them, not
as prophets, in our sense, but merely as poets&mdash;and the
Jews ought to know something of their own literature.</p>

<p>I fear I shall not be able to go to Carmel while you're a
widow&mdash;I've tangled myself up with engagements again.
Moreover, I'm just back from the St. Helena cemetery,
and for a few days shall be too blue for companionship.</p>

<p>"Shifted" is better, I think (in poetry) than "joggled."
You say you "don't like working." Then write a short

<p>It is nice to hear from you and learn that despite my rude
and intolerant ways you manage to slip in a little affection
for me&mdash;you and the rest of the folk. And really I think I
left a little piece of my heart out there&mdash;mostly in Berkeley.
It is funny, by the way, that in falling out of love with
most of my old sweethearts and semi-sweethearts I should
fall <i>in</i> love with my own niece. It is positively scandalous!</p>

<p>I return Sloot's letter. It gave me a bit of a shock to have
him say that he would probably never see me again. Of
course that is true, but I had not thought of it just that
way&mdash;had not permitted myself to, I suppose. And, after
all, if things go as I'm hoping they will, Montesano will
take me in again some day before he seems likely to leave
it. We four may see the Grand Cañon together yet. I'd like
to lay my bones thereabout.</p>

<p>The garments that you persuaded me were mine are not.
They are probably Sterling's, and he has probably damned
me for stealing them. I don't care; he has no right to dress
like the "filthy rich." Hasn't he any "class consciousness"?
However, I am going to send them back to you by
express. I'll mail you the paid receipt; so don't pay the
charge that the company is sure to make. They charged
me again for the two packages that you paid for, and got
away with the money from the Secretary of my club,
where they were delivered. I had to get it back from the
delivery man at the cannon's mouth&mdash;34 calibre.</p>

<p>You asked me about the relative interest of Yosemite and
the Grand Cañon. It is not easy to compare them, they are
so different. In Yosemite only the magnitudes are unfamiliar;
in the Cañon nothing is familiar&mdash;at least, nothing
would be familiar to you, though I have seen something
like it on the upper Yellowstone. The "color scheme" is
astounding&mdash;almost incredible, as is the "architecture."
As to magnitudes, Yosemite is nowhere. From points on
the rim of the Cañon you can see fifty, maybe a hundred,
miles of it. And it is never twice alike. Nobody can describe
it. Of course you must see it sometime. I wish our
Yosemite party could meet there, but probably we never
will; it is a long way from here, and not quite next door to
Berkeley and Carmel.</p>

<p>I've just got settled in my same old tenement house, the

<p>Thank you very much for the work that you are doing

But take your time about it.</p>

<p>I hope you all had a good Thanksgiving at Upshack.
(That is my name for Sloots' place. It will be understood
by anyone that has walked to it from Montesano, carrying<span class="pagenum">166</span>
a basket of grub on a hot day.)</p>

<p>I trust Sterling got his waistcoat and trousers in time to
appear at his uncle's dinner in other outer garments than a
steelpen coat. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I am glad you like (or like to have)
the books. You would have had all my books when published
if I had supposed that you cared for them, or even
knew about them. I am now encouraged to hope that
some day you and Carlt and Sloots may be given the light
to see the truth at the heart of my "views" (which I have
expounded for half a century) and will cease to ally yourselves
with what is most hateful to me, socially and politically.
I shall then feel (in my grave) that perhaps, after all,
I knew how to write. Meantime, run after your false fool
gods until you are tired; I shall not believe that your hearts
are really in the chase, for they are pretty good hearts, and
those of your gods are nests of nastiness and heavens of
hate.</p>

<p>Now I feel better, and shall drink a toddy to the tardy
time when those whom I love shall not think me a perverted
intelligence; when they shall not affirm my intellect
and despise its work&mdash;confess my superior understanding
and condemn all its fundamental conclusions. Then we will
be a happy family&mdash;you and Carlt in the flesh and Sloots
and I in our bones.</p>

<p>You had indeed "something worth writing about"&mdash;not

and disastrous overthrow of that ancient superstition,
Sloots' infallibility as a mushroomer. As I had expected to
be at that dinner, I suppose I should think myself to have
had "a narrow escape." Still, I wish I could have taken my
chance with the rest of you.</p>

<p>How would you like three weeks of nipping cold weather,
with a foot of snow? That's what has been going on here.

<p>I have just received a very affectionate letter from *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
and now know that I did her an injustice in what I carelessly
wrote to you about her incivility to me after I had
left her. It is plain that she did not mean to be uncivil in
what she wrote me on a postal card which I did not look at
until I was in the train; she just "didn't know any better."
So I have restored her to favor, and hope that you will consider
my unkind remarks about her as unwritten. Guess
I'm addicted to going off at half-cock anyhow.</p>

<p>I have the Yosemite book, and Miss Christiansen has the
Mandarin coat. I thank you very much. The pictures are
beautiful, but of them all I prefer that of Nanny bending
over the stove. True, the face is not visible, but it looks like<span class="pagenum">168</span>
you all over.</p>

<p>I'm filling out the book with views of the Grand Cañon,
so as to have my scenic treasures all together. Also I'm trying
to get for you a certain book of Cañon pictures, which I
neglected to obtain when there. You will like it&mdash;if I get it.</p>

<p>Sometime when you have nothing better to do&mdash;don't be
in a hurry about it&mdash;will you go out to Mountain View
cemetery with your camera and take a picture of the grave
of Elizabeth (Lily) Walsh, the little deaf mute that I told
you of? I think the man in the office will locate it for you.
It is in the Catholic part of the cemetery&mdash;St. Mary's.
The name Lily Walsh is on the beveled top of the headstone
which is shaped like this:</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Dear George</span>,</p>

<p>As to the "form of address." A man passing another was
halted by the words: "You dirty dog!" Turning to the
speaker, he bowed coldly and said: "Smith is my name,
sir." <i>My</i> name is Bierce, and I find, on reflection, that I like
best those who call me just that. If my christen name were
George I'd want to be called <i>that</i>; but "Ambrose" is fit
only for mouths of women&mdash;in which it sounds fairly well.</p>

<p><i>How</i> are you my master? I never read one of your poems
without learning something, though not, alas, how to make<span class="pagenum">169</span>
one.</p>

<p>Don't worry about "Lilith"; it will work out all right. As
to the characters not seeming alive, I've always fancied the
men and women of antiquity&mdash;particularly the kings, and
great ones generally&mdash;should not be too flesh-and-bloody,
like the "persons whom one meets." A little coldness and
strangeness is very becoming to them. I like them to <i>stalk</i>,
like the ghosts that they are&mdash;our modern passioning
seems a bit anachronous in them. Maybe I'm wrong, but
I'm sure you will understand and have some sympathy
with the error.</p>

<p>Hudson Maxim takes medicine without biting the spoon.
He had a dose from me and swallowed it smiling. I too gave
him some citations of great poetry that is outside the confines
of his "definition"&mdash;poetry in which are no tropes
at all. He seems to lack the <i>feel</i> of poetry. He even spoils
some of the "great lines" by not including enough of the
context. As to his "improvements," fancy his preference
for "the fiercest spirit of <i>the warrior host</i>" to "the fiercest
spirit <i>that fought in Heaven</i>"! O my!</p>

<p>Yes, Conrad told me the tale of his rescue by you. He
gave me the impression of hanging in the sky above billows
unthinkably huge and rocks inconceivably hard.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Of course I could not but be pleased by your inclusion of
that sonnet on me in your book. And, by the way, I'm
including in my tenth volume my <i>Cosmopolitan</i> article on
the "Wine" and my end of the controversy about it. All the
volumes of the set are to be out by June, saith the publisher.
He is certainly half-killing me with proofs&mdash;mountains
of proofs! *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Yes, you'll doubtless have a recruit in Carlt for your<span class="pagenum">170</span>
Socialist menagerie&mdash;if he is not already a veteran exhibit.
Your "party" is recruited from among sore-heads only.
There are some twenty-five thousand of them (sore-heads)
in this neck o' woods&mdash;all disloyal&mdash;all growling at the
Government which feeds and clothes them twice as well as
they could feed and clothe themselves in private employment.
They move Heaven and Earth to get in, and they
never resign&mdash;just "take it out" in abusing the Government.
If I had my way nobody should remain in the civil
service more than five years&mdash;at the end of that period all
are disloyal. Not one of them cares a rap for the good of the
service or the country&mdash;as we soldiers used to do on thirteen
dollars a month (with starvation, disease and death
thrown in). Their grievance is that the Government does
not undertake to maintain them in the style to which they
choose to accustom themselves. They fix their standard of
living just a little higher than they can afford, and would
do so no matter what salary they got, as all salary-persons
invariably do. Then they damn their employer for not enabling
them to live up to it.</p>

<p>If they can do better "outside" why don't they go outside
and do so; if they can't (which means that they are
getting more than they are worth) what are they complaining
about?</p>

<p>What this country needs&mdash;what every country needs
occasionally&mdash;is a good hard bloody war to revive the vice
of patriotism on which its existence as a nation depends.
Meantime, you socialers, anarchists and other sentimentaliters
and futilitarians will find the civil-service your best
recruiting ground, for it is the Land of Reasonless Discontent.
I yearn for the strong-handed Dictator who will swat
you all on the mouths o' you till you are "heard to cease."<span class="pagenum">171</span>

<p>Every evening coffee is made for me in my rooms, but I
have not yet ventured to take it from <i>your</i> cup for fear of
an accident to the cup. Some of the women in this house
are stark, staring mad about that cup and saucer, and the
plate.</p>

<p>I am very sorry Carlt finds his position in the civil service
so intolerable. If he can do better outside he should resign.
If he can't, why, that means that the Government is doing
better for him than he can do for himself, and you are not
justified in your little tirade about the oppression of "the
masses." "The masses" have been unprosperous from time
immemorial, and always will be. A very simple way to escape
that condition (and the <i>only</i> way) is to elevate oneself
out of that incapable class.</p>

<p>You write like an anarchist and say that if you were a
man you'd <i>be</i> one. I should be sorry to believe that, for I
should lose a very charming niece, and you a most worthy
uncle.</p>

<p>You say that Carlt and Grizzly are not Socialists. Does
that mean that <i>they</i> are anarchists? I draw the line at
anarchists, and would put them all to death if I lawfully
could.</p>

<p>But I fancy your intemperate words are just the babbling
of a thoughtless girl. In any case you ought to know from
my work in literature that I am not the person to whom to
address them. I carry my convictions into my life and conduct,
into my friendships, affections and all my relations
with my fellow creatures. So I think it would be more considerate<span class="pagenum">172</span>
to leave out of your letters to <i>me</i> some things that
you may have in mind. Write them to others.</p>

<p>My own references to socialism, and the like, have been
jocular&mdash;I did not think you perverted "enough to hurt,"
though I consider your intellectual environment a mighty
bad one. As to such matters in future let us make a treaty

<p>It is pleasant to know that the family Robertson is "seeing
things" and enjoying them. I hate travel, but find it
delightful when done by you, instead of me. Believe me, I
have had great pleasure in following you by your trail of
words, as in the sport known as the "paper chase."</p>

<p>And now about the little story. Your refusal to let your
father amend it is no doubt dreadfully insubordinate, but I
brave his wrath by approval. It is <i>your</i> work that I want to
see, not anybody's else. I've a profound respect for your
father's talent: as a litérateur, he is the best physician that
I know; but he must not be coaching my pupil, or he and I
(as Mark Twain said of Mrs. Astor) "will have a falling
out."</p>

<p>The story is not a story. It is not narrative, and nothing
occurs. It is a record of mental mutations&mdash;of spiritual
vicissitudes&mdash;states of mind. That is the most difficult
thing that you could have attempted. It can be done acceptably
by genius and the skill that comes of practice, as
can anything. You are not quite equal to it&mdash;yet. You
have done it better than I could have done it at your age,
but not altogether well; as doubtless you did not expect to
do it. It would be better to confine yourself at present to
simple narrative. Write of something done, not of something<span class="pagenum">173</span>
thought and felt, except incidentally. I'm sure it is in
you to do great work, but in this writing trade, as in other
matters, excellence is to be attained no otherwise than by
beginning at the beginning&mdash;the simple at first, then the
complex and difficult. You can not go up a mountain by a
leap at the peak.</p>

<p>I'm retaining your little sketch till your return, for you
can do nothing with it&mdash;nor can I. If it had been written&mdash;preferably
typewritten&mdash;with wide lines and margins I
could do something <i>to</i> it. Maybe when I get the time I
shall; at present I am swamped with "proofs" and two
volumes behind the printers. If I knew that I should <i>see</i>
you and talk it over I should rewrite it and (original in
hand) point out the reasons for each alteration&mdash;you
would see them quickly enough when shown. Maybe you
will all come this way.</p>

<p>You are <i>very</i> deficient in spelling. I hope that is not incurable,
though some persons&mdash;clever ones, too&mdash;never do
learn to spell correctly. You will have to learn it from your
reading&mdash;noting carefully all but the most familiar words.</p>

<p>You have "pet" words&mdash;nearly all of us have. One of
yours is "flickering." Addiction to certain words is an "upsetting
sin" most difficult to overcome. Try to overcome it
by cutting them out where they seem most felicitous.</p>

<p>By the way, your "hero," as you describe him, would not
have been accessible to all those spiritual impressions&mdash;it
is <i>you</i> to whom they come. And that confirms my judgment
of your imagination. Imagination is nine parts of the
writing trade. With enough of <i>that</i> all things are possible;
but it is the other things that require the hard work, the
incessant study, the tireless seeking, the indomitable will.
It is no "pic-nic," this business of writing, believe me. Success<span class="pagenum">174</span>
comes by favor of the gods, yes; but O the days and
nights that you must pass before their altars, prostrate and
imploring! They are exacting&mdash;the gods; years and years
of service you must give in the temple. If you are prepared
to do this go on to your reward. If not, you can not too
quickly throw away the pen and&mdash;well, marry, for example.</p>

<p class="poem">"Drink deep or taste not the Pierian spring."</p>

<p>You must have had a good time with the Sterlings, and
doubtless you all suffered from overfeeding.</p>

<p>Carlt's action in denuding the shaggy pelt of his hands
meets with my highest commendation, but you'd better
look out. It may mean that he has a girl&mdash;a Jewess descended
from Jacob, with an hereditary antipathy to anything

<p>I've been having noctes ambrosianæ with "The House of
Orchids," though truly it came untimely, for I've not yet
done reading your other books. Don't crowd the dancers,
please. I don't know (and you don't care) what poem in it
I like best, but I get as much delight out of these lines as
out of any:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span class="o1">"Such flowers pale as are</span><br />
Worn by the goddess of a distant star&mdash;<br />
Before whose holy eyes<br />
Beauty and evening meet."</p>

<p>And&mdash;but what's the use? I can't quote the entire book.</p>

<p>I'm glad you did see your way to make "Memory" a
female.</p>

<p>To Hades with Bonnet's chatter of gems and jewels&mdash;among
the minor poetic properties they are better (to my
taste) than flowers. By the way, I wonder what "lightness"
Bonnet found in the "Apothecary" verses. They seem to
me very serious.</p>

<p>Rereading and rerereading of the Job confirm my first
opinion of it. I find only one "bad break" in it&mdash;and that
not inconsistent with God's poetry in the real Job: "ropes
of adamant." A rope of stone is imperfectly conceivable&mdash;is,
in truth, mixed metaphor.</p>

<p>I think it was a mistake for you to expound to Ned Hamilton,
or anybody, how you wrote the "Forty-third Chapter,"
or anything. When an author explains his methods of<span class="pagenum">176</span>
composition he cannot expect to be taken seriously. Nine
writers in ten wish to have it thought that they "dash off"
things. Nobody believes it, and the judicious would be

typoscript, and fear that I was to have returned it. Pray
God it was not my neglect to do so that kept it out of the
book. But if not, what did keep it out? Maybe the fact that
it requires in the reader an uncommon acquaintance with
the Scriptures.</p>

<p>If Robertson publishes any more books for you don't let
him use "silver" leaf on the cover. It is not silver, cannot
be neatly put on, and will come off. The "Wine" book is
incomparably better and more tasteful than either of the
others. By the way, I stick to my liking for Scheff's little
vignette on the "Wine."</p>

<p>In "Duandon" you&mdash;<i>you</i>, Poet of the Heavens!&mdash;come
perilously near to qualifying yourself for "mention" in a
certain essay of mine on the blunders of writers and artists
in matters lunar. You must have observed that immediately
after the full o' the moon the light of that orb takes
on a redness, and when it rises after dark is hardly a
"towering glory," nor a "frozen splendor." Its "web" is
not "silver." In truth, the gibbous moon, rising, has something<span class="pagenum">177</span>
of menace in its suggestion. Even twenty-four (or
rather twenty-five) hours "after the full" this change in
the quality and quantity of its light is very marked. I don't
know what causes the sudden alteration, but it has always
impressed me.</p>

<p>I feel a little like signing this criticism "Gradgrind," but
anyhow it may amuse you.</p>

<p>Do you mind squandering ten cents and a postage stamp
on me? I want a copy of <i>Town Talk</i>&mdash;the one in which you
are a "Varied Type."</p>

<p>I don't know much of some of your poets mentioned in
that article, but could wish that you had said a word about
Edith Thomas. Thank you for your too generous mention
of me&mdash;who brought you so much vilification!</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">My dear Ruth,</span></p>

<p>You are a faithful correspondent; I have your postals
from Athens and Syracuse, and now the letter from Rome.
The Benares sketch was duly received, and I wrote you
about it to the address that you gave&mdash;Cairo, I think. As
you will doubtless receive my letter in due time I will not
now repeat it&mdash;further than to say that I liked it. If it had
been accompanied by a few photographs (indispensable
now to such articles) I should have tried to get it into some
magazine. True, Benares, like all other Asiatic and European
cities, is pretty familiar to even the "general reader,"
but the sketch had something of the writer's personality in
it&mdash;the main factor in all good writing, as in all forms of
art.</p>

<p>May I tell you what you already know&mdash;that you are<span class="pagenum">178</span>
deficient in spelling and punctuation? It is worth while to
know these things&mdash;and all things that you can acquire.
Some persons can not acquire orthography, and I don't
wonder, but every page of every good book is a lesson in
punctuation. One's punctuation is a necessary part of one's
style; you cannot attain to precision if you leave that matter
to editors and printers.</p>

<p>You ask if "stories" must have action. The name "story"
is preferably used of narrative, not reflection nor mental
analysis. The "psychological novel" is in great vogue just
now, for example&mdash;the adventures of the mind, it might be
called&mdash;but it requires a profounder knowledge of life and
character than is possible to a young girl of whatever talent;
and the psychological "short story" is even more difficult.
Keep to narrative and simple description for a few
years, until your wings have grown. These descriptions of
foreign places that you write me are good practice. You are
not likely to tell me much that I do not know, nor is that
necessary; but your way of telling what I do know is sometimes
very interesting as a study of <i>you</i>. So write me all you
will, and if you would like the letters as a record of your
travels you shall have them back; I am preserving them.</p>

<p>I judge from your letter that your father went straight
through without bothering about me. Maybe I should not
have seen him anyhow, for I was away from Washington
for nearly a month.</p>

<p>Please give my love to your mother and sister, whom, of
course, you are to bring here. I shall not forgive you if you
do not.</p>

<p>Yes, I wish that you lived nearer to me, so that we could
go over your work together. I could help you more in a few
weeks <i>that</i> way than in years <i>this</i> way. God never does anything<span class="pagenum">179</span>
just right.</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Dear George</span>,</p>

<p>Thank you for that Times "review." It is a trifle less
malicious than usual&mdash;regarding <i>me</i>, that is all. My publisher,
Neale, who was here last evening, is about "taking
action" against that concern for infringement of his copyright
in my little book, "Write It Right." The wretches
have been serving it up to their readers for several weeks as
the work of a woman named Learned. Repeatedly she uses
my very words&mdash;whole passages of them. They refused
even to confess the misdeeds of their contributrix, and persist
in their sin. So they will have to fight.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I have never been hard on women whose hearts go
with their admiration, and whose bodies follow their hearts&mdash;I
don't mean that the latter was the case in this instance.
Nor am I very exacting as to the morality of my men
friends. I would not myself take another man's woman,
any more than I would take his purse. Nor, I trust, would
I seduce the daughter or sister of a friend, nor any maid
whom it would at all damage&mdash;and as to <i>that</i> there is no
hard and fast rule.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>A fine fellow, I, to be casting the first stone, or the one-hundredth,
at a lovelorn woman, weak or strong! By the
way, I should not believe in the love of a strong one, wife,
widow or maid.</p>

<p>It looks as if I may get to Sag Harbor for a week or so in
the middle of the month. It is really not a question of expense,
but Neale has blocked out a lot of work for me. He
wants two more volumes&mdash;even five more if I'll make 'em.
Guess I'll give him two. In a week or so I shall be able to<span class="pagenum">180</span>
say whether I can go Sagharboring. If so, I think we should
have a night in New York first, no? You could motor-boat
up and back.</p>

<p>In one of your letters you were good enough to promise
me a motorboat trip from New York to Sag Harbor. I can
think of few things more delightful than navigating in a
motorboat the sea that I used to navigate in an open canoe;
it will seem like Progress. So if you are still in that mind
please write me what day <i>after Saturday next</i> you can meet
me in New York and I'll be there. I should prefer that you
come the day before the voyage and dine with me that
evening.</p>

<p>I always stay at the Hotel Navarre, 7th avenue and 38th

<p>Kindly convey to young Smith of Auburn my felicitations
on his admirable "Ode to the Abyss"&mdash;a large theme,
treated with dignity and power. It has many striking passages&mdash;such,
for example, as "The Romes of ruined
spheres." I'm conscious of my sin against the rhetoricians
in liking that, for it jolts the reader out of the Abyss and<span class="pagenum">181</span>
back to earth. Moreover, it is a metaphor which belittles,
instead of dignifying. But I like it.</p>

<p>It is good to know that you are again happy&mdash;that is to
say, you are in Carmel. For your <i>future</i> happiness (if success
and a certain rounding off of your corners would bring
it, as I think) I could wish you in New York or thereabout.
As the Scripture hath it: "It is not good for a man to be in
Carmel"&mdash;<i>Revised Inversion</i>. I note that at the late election
California damned herself to a still lower degradation
and is now unfit for a white man to live in. Initiative, referendum,
recall, employers' liability, woman suffrage&mdash;yah!</p>

I like him personally very well; he talks like a normal human
being. It is only that damned book of his. He was here
and came out to my tenement a few evenings ago, finding
me in bed and helpless from lumbago, as I was for weeks. I
am now able to sit up and take notice, and there are even
fears for my recovery. My enemies would say, as Byron
said of Lady B., I am becoming "dangerously well again."</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>As to harlots, there are not ten in a hundred that are such
for any other reason than that they wanted to be. Their<span class="pagenum">182</span>
exculpatory stories are mostly lies of magnitude.</p>

<p>Sloots writes me that he will perhaps "walk over" from
the mine to Yosemite next summer. I can't get there much
before July first, but if there is plenty of snow in the mountains
next winter the valley should be visitable then. Later,
I hope to beguest myself for a few days at the Pine Inn,
Carmel. Tell it not to the Point Lobos mussel!</p>

<p>As you do not give me that lady's address I infer that you
no longer care to have me meet her&mdash;which is a relief to me.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Yes, I'm a bit broken up by the death of Pollard, whose
body I assisted to burn. He lost his mind, was paralyzed,
had his head cut open by the surgeons, and his sufferings
were unspeakable. Had he lived he would have been an
idiot; so it is all right&mdash;</p>

<p class="poem">"But O, the difference to me!"</p>

<p>If you don't think him pretty bright read any of his last
three books, "Their Day in Court," "Masks and Minstrels,"
and "Vagabond Journeys." He did not see the
last one&mdash;Neale brought down copies of it when he came
to Baltimore to attend the funeral.</p>

<p>I'm hoping that if Carlt and Lora go to Wagner's mine
and we go to Yosemite, Lora, at least, will come to us out
there. We shall need her, though Carrie will find that
Misses C. and S. will be "no deadheads in the enterprise"&mdash;to
quote a political phrase of long ago. As to me, I shall
leave my ten-pounds-each books at home and, like St.<span class="pagenum">183</span>
Jerome, who never traveled with other baggage than a
skull, be "flying light."

<p>It is good to hear from you again, even if I did have to
give you a hint that I badly needed a letter.</p>

<p>I am glad that you are going to the mine (if you go)&mdash;though
Berkeley and Oakland will not be the same without
you. And where can I have my mail forwarded?&mdash;and be
permitted to climb in at the window to get it. As to pot-steaks,
toddies, and the like, I shall simply swear off eating
and drinking.</p>

<p>If Carlt is a "game sport," and does not require "a dead-sure
thing," the mining gamble is the best bet for him.
Anything to get out of that deadening, hopeless grind, the
"Government service." It kills a man's self-respect, atrophies
his powers, unfits him for anything, tempts him to
improvidence and then turns him out to starve.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to know that there is a hope of meeting you
in Yosemite&mdash;the valley would not be the same without
you. My girls cannot leave here till the schools close, about
June 20, so we shall not get into the valley much before
July first; but if you have a good winter, with plenty of
snow, that will do. We shall stay as long as we like. George
says he and Carrie can go, and I hope Sloots can. It is likely
that Neale, my publisher, will be of my party. I shall hope
to visit your mine afterward.</p>

<p>I'm a long time noticing your letter of January fifth,
chiefly because, like Teddy, "I have nothing to say."
There's this difference atwixt him and me&mdash;I could say
something if I tried.</p>

<p>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* I'm hoping that you are at work and doing something
worth while, though I see nothing of yours. Battle
against the encroaching abalone should not engage all your
powers. That spearing salmon at night interests me, though
doubtless the "season" will be over before I visit Carmel.</p>

<p>Bear Yosemite in mind for latter part of June, and use
influence with Lora and Grizzly, even if Carlt should be
inhumed in his mine.</p>

<p>We've had about seven weeks of snow and ice, the mercury
around the zero mark most of the time. Once it was 13
below. You'd not care for that sort of thing, I fancy. Indeed,
I'm a bit fatigued of it myself, and on Saturday next,
God willing, shall put out my prow to sea and bring up, I
hope, in Bermuda, not, of course, to remain long.</p>

<p>I did not go to Bermuda; so I'm not "back." But I did go
to Richmond, a city whose tragic and pathetic history, of
which one is reminded by everything that one sees there,
always gets on to my nerves with a particular dejection.
True, the history is some fifty years old, but it is always
with me when I'm there, making solemn eyes at me.</p>

<p>You're right about "this season in the East." It has indeed
been penetential. For the first time I am thoroughly
disgusted and half-minded to stay in California when I go&mdash;a
land where every prospect pleases, and only labor unions,
progressives, suffragettes (and socialists) are vile. No, I don't
think I could stand California, though I'm still in the mind
to visit it in June. I shall be sorry to miss Carrie at Carmel, but
hope to have the two of you on some excursion or
camping trip. We <i>want</i> to go to Yosemite, which the girls
have not seen, but if there's no water there it may not be
advisable. Guess we'll have to let you natives decide. How
would the Big Trees do as a substitute?</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Girls is pizen, but not necessarily fatal. I've taken 'em in
large doses all my life, and suffered pangs enough to equip
a number of small Hells, but never has one of them paralyzed
the inner working man. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* But I'm not a poet.
Moreover, as I've not yet put off my armor I oughtn't to
boast.</p>

<p>So&mdash;you've subscribed for the Collected Works. Good!
that is what you ought to have done a long time ago. It is
what every personal friend of mine ought to have done, for
all profess admiration of my work in literature. It is what
I was fool enough to permit my publisher to think that
many of them would do. How many do you guess have
done so? I'll leave you guessing. God help the man with<span class="pagenum">186</span>
many friends, for <i>they</i> will not. My royalties on the sets
sold to my friends are less than one-fourth of my outlay in
free sets for other friends. Tell me not in cheerful numbers

<p>Thank you for the poems, which I've not had the time to

I don't altogether share your reverence for Browning, but
the primacy of your verses on him over the others printed
on the same page is almost startling. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Of course it's all nonsense about the waning of your
power&mdash;though thinking it so might make it so. My notion
is that you've only <i>begun</i> to do things. But I wish you'd go
back to your chain in your uncle's office. I'm no believer in
adversity and privation as a spur to Pegasus. They are
oftener a "hopple." The "meagre, muse-rid mope, adust
and thin" will commonly do better work when tucked out
with three square meals a day, and having the sure and

<p>I'm expecting to arrive in Oakland (Key Route Inn,

<p>I thank you for the article from <i>The Argonaut</i>, and am

and thereby enables me to explain something.</p>

<p>When, several years ago, you sent me a similar article I

(I am a member of the Society that issues it) and suggested
its publication. I left it with him and hearing nothing
about it for several months called at his office <i>twice</i> for
an answer, and for the copy if publication was refused.
The copy had been "mislaid"&mdash;lost, apparently&mdash;and I
never obtained it. Meantime, either I had "mislaid" your
address, or it was only on the copy. So I was unable to
write you. Indirectly, afterward, I heard that you had left
California for parts to me unknown.</p>

"have to go at that," for I've no expectation of ever seeing
California again. I like the country as well as ever, but I

So far as I am concerned they may stew in their

<p>Another good friend of mine, whom, however I did not
succeed in seeing during either of my visits to California, is
W. C. Morrow, who is a professional teacher of writing and
himself a splendid writer. He could help you. He lives in
San Francisco, but I think has a class in Oakland. I don't
know his address; you'll find it in the directory. He used to<span class="pagenum">189</span>
write stories splendidly tragic, but I'm told he now teaches
the "happy ending," in which he is right&mdash;commercially&mdash;but
disgusting. I can cordially recommend him.</p>

<p>Keep up your German and French of course. If your
English (your mother speech) is so defective, think what
<i>they</i> must be.</p>

<p>I'll think of some books that will be helpful to you in your
English. Meantime send me anything that you care to that
you write. It will at least show me what progress you make.</p>

<p>I'm returning some (all, I think) of your sketches. Don't
destroy them&mdash;yet. Maybe some day you'll find them
worth rewriting.</p>

<p>It is pleasant to know that you are not easily discouraged
by the croaking of such ravens as I, and I confess that the
matter of the "civic centre" supplies some reason to hope
for prosperity to the Cahill projection&mdash;which (another
croak) will doubtless bear some other man's name, probably
Hayford's or Woodward's.</p>

<p>I sent the "Argonaut" article to my friend Dr. Franklin,
of Schenectady, a "scientific gent" of some note, but have
heard nothing from him.</p>

<p>I'm returning the "Chronicle" article, which I found interesting.
If I were not a writer without an "organ" I'd have
a say about that projection. For near four years I've been
out of the newspaper game&mdash;a mere compiler of my collected
works in twelve volumes&mdash;and shall probably never
"sit into the game" again, being seventy years old. My

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Dear Lora</span>,</p>

<p>I have been searching for your letter of long ago, fearing
it contained something that I should have replied to. But I
don't find it; so I make the convenient assumption that it
did not.</p>

<p>I'd like to hear from you, however unworthy I am to do
so, for I want to know if you and Carlt have still a hope of
going mining. Pray God you do, if there's a half-chance of
success; for success in the service of the Government is
failure.</p>

<p>Winter here is two-thirds gone and we have not had a
cold day, and only one little dash of snow&mdash;on Christmas
eve. Can California beat that? I'm told it's as cold there as
in Greenland.</p>

<p>Tell me about yourself&mdash;your health since the operation&mdash;how
it has affected you&mdash;all about you. My own health
is excellent; I'm equal to any number of Carlt's toddies. By
the way, Blanche has made me a co-defendant with you in
the crime (once upon a time) of taking a drop too much. I
plead not guilty&mdash;how do <i>you</i> plead? Sloots, at least,
would acquit us on the ground of inability&mdash;that one
<i>can't</i> take too much. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p class="p4"><span class="smcap">Dear Ruth</span>,</p>

<p>I'm returning your little sketches with a few markings
which are to be regarded (or disregarded) as mere suggestions.
I made them in pencil, so that you can erase them if
you don't approve. Of course I should make many more if<span class="pagenum">191</span>
I could have you before me so that I could explain <i>why</i>; in
this way I can help you but little. You'll observe that I
have made quite a slaughter of some of the adjectives in
some of your sentences&mdash;you will doubtless slaughter some
in others. Nearly all young writers use too many adjectives.
Indeed, moderation and skill in the use of adjectives
are about the last things a good writer learns. Don't use
those that are connoted by the nouns; and rather than
have all the nouns, or nearly all, in a sentence outfitted
with them it is better to make separate sentences for some
of those desired.</p>

<p>In your sketch "Triumph" I would not name the "hero"
of the piece. To do so not only makes the sketch commonplace,
but it logically requires you to name his victim too,
and her offense; in brief, it commits you to a <i>story</i>.</p>

<p>A famous writer (perhaps Holmes or Thackeray&mdash;I don't
remember) once advised a young writer to cut all the passages
that he thought particularly good. Your taste I think
is past the need of so heroic treatment as that, but the advice
may be profitably borne in memory whenever you are
in doubt, if ever you are. And sometimes you will be.</p>

<p>I think I know what Mr. Morrow meant by saying that
your characters are not "humanly significant." He means
that they are not such persons as one meets in everyday
life&mdash;not "types." I confess that I never could see why
one's characters <i>should</i> be. The exceptional&mdash;even "abnormal"&mdash;person
seems to me the more interesting, but I
must warn you that he will not seem so to an editor. Nor to
an editor will the tragic element seem so good as the cheerful&mdash;the
sombre denouement as the "happy ending." One
must have a pretty firm reputation as a writer to "send in"
a tragic or supernatural tale with any hope of its acceptance.<span class="pagenum">192</span>
The average mind (for which editors purvey, and
mostly possess) dislikes, or thinks it dislikes, any literature
that is not "sunny." True, tragedy holds the highest and
most permanent place in the world's literature and art, but
it has the divvel's own time getting to it. For immediate
popularity (if one cares for it) one must write pleasant
things; though one may put in here and there a bit of
pathos.</p>

<p>I think well of these two manuscripts, but doubt if you
can get them into any of our magazines&mdash;if you want to.
As to that, nobody can help you. About the only good
quality that a magazine editor commonly has is his firm
reliance on the infallibility of his own judgment. It is an
honest error, and it enables him to mull through somehow
with a certain kind of consistency. The only way to get a
footing with him is to send him what you think he wants,
not what you think he ought to want&mdash;and keep sending.
But perhaps you do not care for the magazines.</p>

<p>I note a great improvement in your style&mdash;probably no
more than was to be expected of your better age, but a distinct
improvement. It is a matter of regret with me that I
have not the training of you; we should see what would
come of it. You certainly have no reason for discouragement.
But if you are to be a writer you must "cut out" the
dances and the teas (a little of the theater may be allowed)
and <i>work</i> right heartily. The way of the good writer is no
primrose path.</p>

<p>No, I have not read the poems of Service. What do I
think of Edith Wharton? Just what Pollard thought&mdash;see
<i>Their Day in Court</i>, which I think you have.</p>

<p>I fear you have the wanderlust incurably. I never had it
bad, and have less of it now than ever before. I shall not<span class="pagenum">193</span>
see California again.</p>

<p>You were so long in replying to my letter of the century
before last, and as your letter is not really a reply to anything
in mine, that I fancy you did not get it. I don't recollect,<span class="pagenum">194</span>
for example, that you ever acknowledged receipt of
little pictures of myself, though maybe you did&mdash;I only
hope you got them. The photographs that you send are
very interesting. One of them makes me thirsty&mdash;the one
of that fountainhead of good booze, your kitchen sink.</p>

<p>What you say of the mine and how you are to be housed
there pleases me mightily. That's how I should like to live,
and mining is what I should like again to do. Pray God you
be not disappointed.</p>

<p>Alas, I cannot even join you during Carlt's vacation, for
the mountain ramble. Please "go slow" in your goating
this year. I <i>think</i> you are better fitted for it than ever before,
but you'd better ask your surgeon about that. By the
way, do you know that since women took to athletics their
peculiar disorders have increased about fifty per cent? You
can't make men of women. The truth is, they've taken to
walking on their hind legs a few centuries too soon. Their

<p>Your letter was forwarded to me in New York, whence I
have just returned. I fancy you had a more satisfactory
outing than I. I never heard of the Big Sur river nor of
"Arbolado." But I'm glad you went there, for I'm hearing
so much about Hetch Hetchy that I'm tired of it. I'm helping
the San Francisco crowd (a little) to "ruin" it.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I'm glad to know that you still expect to go to the mine.
Success or failure, it is better than the Mint, and you ought<span class="pagenum">195</span>
to live in the mountains where you can climb things whenever
you want to.</p>

<p>Of course I know nothing of Neale's business&mdash;you'd
better write to him if he has not filled your order. I suppose
you know that volumes eleven and twelve are not included
in the "set."</p>

<p>If you care to write to me again please do so at once as I

<p>The reason that I did not answer your letter sooner is&mdash;I
have been away (in New York) and did not have it with
me. I suppose I shall not see your book for a long time, for I

expect to go to, perhaps across, South America&mdash;possibly
via Mexico, if I can get through without being stood up

<p>Thank you for the book. I thank you for your friendship&mdash;and
much besides. This is to say good-by at the end of a
pleasant correspondence in which your woman's prerogative
of having the last word is denied to you. Before I could<span class="pagenum">196</span>
receive it I shall be gone. But some time, somewhere, I
hope to hear from you again. Yes, I shall go into Mexico
with a pretty definite purpose, which, however, is not at
present disclosable. You must try to forgive my obstinacy
in not "perishing" where I am. I want to be where something

<p>I think I owe you a letter, and probably this is my only
chance to pay up for a long time. For more than a month I
have been rambling about the country, visiting my old
battlefields, passing a few days in New Orleans, a week in
San Antonio, and so forth. I turned up here this morning.
There is a good deal of fighting going on over on the Mexican
side of the Rio Grande, but I hold to my intention to
go into Mexico if I can. In the character of "innocent bystander"
I ought to be fairly safe if I don't have too much
money on me, don't you think? My eventual destination is
South America, but probably I shall not get there this year.</p>

<p>Sloots writes me that you and Carlt still expect to go to

<p>I wrote you yesterday at San Antonio, but dated the letter
here and today, expecting to bring the letter and mail it
here. That's because I did not know if I would have time
to write it here. Unfortunately, I forgot and posted it,<span class="pagenum">198</span>
with other letters, where it was written. Thus does man's
guile come to naught!</p>

<p>Well, I'm here, anyhow, and have time to explain.</p>

<p>Laredo was a Mexican city before it was an American. It
is Mexican now, five to one. Nuevo Laredo, opposite, is
held by the Huertistas and Americans don't go over there.
In fact a guard on the bridge will not let them. So those
that sneak across have to wade (which can be done almost
anywhere) and go at night.</p>

<p>I shall not be here long enough to hear from you, and

<p>You are right too&mdash;dead right about the poetry of Socialism;
and you might have added the poetry of wailing about
the woes of the poor generally. Only the second- and the
third-raters write it&mdash;except "incidentally." You don't
find the big fellows sniveling over that particular shadow-side
of Nature. Yet not only are the poor always with us,
they always <i>were</i> with us, and their state was worse in the
times of Homer, Virgil, Shakspeare, Milton and the others
than in the days of Morris and Markham.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/newlettera.png" width="70" height="13" alt="end of letter" />

<p>But what's the use? I have long despaired of convincing
poets and artists of anything, even that white is not black.
I'm convinced that all you chaps ought to have a world to
yourselves, where two and two make whatever you prefer
that it <i>should</i> make, and cause and effect are remoulded
"more nearly to the heart's desire." And then I suppose I'd
want to go and live there too.</p>

<p>Did you ever know so poor satire to make so great a row
as that of Watson? Compared with certain other verses
against particular women&mdash;Byron's "Born in a garret, in a
kitchen bred"; even my own skit entitled "Mad" (pardon
my modesty) it is infantile. What an interesting book
might be made of such "attacks" on women! But Watson<span class="pagenum">200</span>
is the only one of us, so far as I remember, who has had the
caddishness to <i>name</i> the victim.</p>

<p>Have you seen Percival Pollard's "Their Day in Court"?
It is amusing, clever&mdash;and more. He has a whole chapter
on me, "a lot" about Gertrude Atherton, and much else
that is interesting. And he skins alive certain popular gods
and goddesses of the day, and is "monstrous naughty."</p>

<p>As to *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*'s own character I do not see what that has
to do with his criticism of London. If only the impeccable

<p>The friends that warned you against the precarious nature
of my friendship were right. To hold my regard one
must fulfil hard conditions&mdash;hard if one is not what one
should be; easy if one is. I have, indeed, a habit of calmly
considering the character of a man with whom I have fallen
into any intimacy and, whether I have any grievance
against him or not, informing him by letter that I no
longer desire his acquaintance. This, I do after deciding
that he is not truthful, candid, without conceit, and so
forth&mdash;in brief, honorable. If any one is conscious that he
is not in all respects worthy of my friendship he would better
not cultivate it, for assuredly no one can long conceal
his true character from an observant student of it. Yes, my
friendship is a precarious possession. It grows more so the
longer I live, and the less I feel the need of a multitude of
friends. So, if in your heart you are conscious of being any<span class="pagenum">201</span>
of the things which you accuse <i>me</i> of being, or anything
else equally objectionable (to <i>me</i>) I can only advise you to
drop me before I drop you.</p>

<p>Certainly you have an undoubted right to your opinion
of my ability, my attainments and my standing. If you
choose to publish a censorious judgment of these matters,
do so by all means: I don't think I ever cared a cent for
what was printed about me, except as it supplied me with
welcome material for my pen. One may presumably have a
"sense of duty to the public," and the like. But convincing
one person (one at a time) of one's friend's deficiencies is
hardly worth while, and is to be judged differently. It
comes under another rule. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Maybe, as you say, my work lacks "soul," but my life
does not, as a man's life is the man. Personally, I hold that
sentiment has a place in this world, and that loyalty to a
friend is not inferior as a characteristic to correctness of
literary judgment. If there is a heaven I think it is more
valued there. If Mr. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* (your publisher as well as mine)
had considered you a Homer, a Goethe or a Shakspeare a
team of horses could not have drawn from <i>me</i> the expression
of a lower estimate. And let me tell you that if you are
going through life as a mere thinking machine, ignoring the
generous promptings of the heart, sacrificing it to the
brain, you will have a hard row to hoe, and the outcome,
when you survey it from the vantage ground of age, will
not please you. You seem to me to be beginning rather
badly, as regards both your fortune and your peace of
mind.</p>

<p class="center">*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>I saw *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* every day while in New York, and he does not
know that I feel the slightest resentment toward you, nor<span class="pagenum">202</span>
do I know it myself. So far as he knows, or is likely to know
(unless you will have it otherwise) you and I are the best of
friends, or rather, I am the best of friends to you. And I
guess that is so. I could no more hate you for your disposition
and character than I could for your hump if you had
one. You are as Nature has made you, and your defects,
whether they are great or small, are your misfortunes. I
would remove them if I could, but I know that I cannot,
for one of them is inability to discern the others, even when
they are pointed out.</p>

<p>I must commend your candor in one thing. You confirm
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* words in saying that you commented on "my seeming
lack of sympathy with certain modern masters," which
you attribute to my not having read them. That is a conclusion
to which a low order of mind in sympathy with the
"modern masters" naturally jumps, but it is hardly
worthy of a man of your brains. It is like your former lofty
assumption that I had not read some ten or twelve philosophers,
naming them, nearly all of whom I had read, and
laughed at, before you were born. In fact, one of your most
conspicuous characteristics is the assumption that what a
man who does not care to "talk shop" does not speak of,
and vaunt his knowledge of, he does not know. I once
thought this a boyish fault, but you are no longer a boy.
Your "modern masters" are Ibsen and Shaw, with both of
whose works and ways I am thoroughly familiar, and both
of whom I think very small men&mdash;pets of the drawing-room
and gods of the hour. No, I am not an "up to date"
critic, thank God. I am not a literary critic at all, and never,
or very seldom, have gone into that field except in pursuance
of a personal object&mdash;to help a good writer (who is
commonly a friend)&mdash;maybe you can recall such instances&mdash;or<span class="pagenum">203</span>
laugh at a fool. Surely you do not consider my work
in the Cosmopolitan (mere badinage and chaff, the only
kind of stuff that the magazine wants from me, or will
print) essays in literary criticism. It has never occurred to
me to look upon myself as a literary critic; if you <i>must</i>
prick my bubble please to observe that it contains more of
your breath than of mine. Yet you have sometimes seemed to
value, I thought, some of my notions about even poetry. *&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

<p>Perhaps I am unfortunate in the matter of keeping
friends; I know, and have abundant reason to know, that
you are at least equally luckless in the matter of making
them. I could put my finger on the very qualities in you
that make you so, and the best service that I could do you
would be to point them out and take the consequences.
That is to say, it would serve you many years hence; at
present you are like Carlyle's "Mankind"; you "refuse to
be served." You only consent to be enraged.</p>

<p>I bear you no ill will, shall watch your career in letters
with friendly solicitude&mdash;have, in fact, just sent to the
*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* a most appreciative paragraph about your book,
which may or may not commend itself to the editor; most
of what I write does not. I hope to do a little, now and then,
to further your success in letters. I wish you were different
(and that is the harshest criticism that I ever uttered of
you except to yourself) and wish it for your sake more than
for mine. I am older than you and probably more "acquainted
with grief"&mdash;the grief of disappointment and
disillusion. If in the future you are convinced that you have
become different, and I am still living, my welcoming hand
awaits you. And when I forgive I forgive all over, even the
new offence.</p>

<p>Miller undoubtedly is sincere in his praise of you, for with<span class="pagenum">204</span>
all his faults and follies he is always generous and usually
over generous to other poets. There's nothing little and
mean in him. Sing ho for Joaquin!</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/newlettera.png" width="70" height="13" alt="end of letter" />
</div>

<p>If I "made you famous" please remember that you were
guilty of contributory negligence by meriting the fame.
"Eternal vigilance" is the price of its permanence. Don't
loaf on your job.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/newlettera.png" width="70" height="13" alt="end of letter" />
</div>

<p>I have told her of a certain "enchanted forest" hereabout
to which I feel myself sometimes strongly drawn as a fitting
place to lay down "my weary body and my head." (Perhaps
you remember your Swinburne:</p>

<p class="poem">
<span class="o1">"Ah yet, would God this flesh of mine might be</span><br />
Where air might wash and long leaves cover me!<br />
Ah yet, would God that roots and stems were bred<br />
Out of my weary body and my head.")</p>

<p>The element of enchantment in that forest is supplied by
my wandering and dreaming in it forty-one years ago when
I was a-soldiering and there were new things under a new
sun. It is miles away, but from a near-by summit I can
overlook the entire region&mdash;ridge beyond ridge, parted by
purple valleys full of sleep. Unlike me, it has not visibly
altered in all these years, except that I miss, here and there,
a thin blue ghost of smoke from an enemy's camp. Can you
guess my feelings when I view this Dream-land&mdash;my
Realm of Adventure, inhabited by memories that beckon
me from every valley? I shall go; I shall retrace my old
routes and lines of march; stand in my old camps; inspect
my battlefields to see that all is right and undisturbed. I
shall go to the Enchanted Forest.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
